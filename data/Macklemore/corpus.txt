Wow, we're here on this stage right now.

First and foremost, I want to thank our fans, the people that got us on this stage. Before there was any media, before there was any buzz about us, before there was a story, there was our fans and it spread organically through them so without them there would be no us. Shout out to everybody repping worldwide.

I want to thank my beautiful fiancee, my parents, my manager, and our team that puts together this music, that sacrifices everything for this art. Countless hours in the studio and onstage and everyone that made this album what it is. I love you guys.

And I want to say, we made this album without a record label, we made it independently, and we appreciate all the support.

[Intro: Evan Roman]
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say thirty's the new twenty
And twenty's the new thirty, shit I guess
Makes sense, 'cause fifteen-year-olds seem twenty
And twenty-five -year-olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basehead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, who's got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
If cynical hispters with long hair
And cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
They say, "It's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth"
The guns - that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less conscious
Than rappers rapping 'bout them strippers up on a pole, popping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that "Its poetry, youre so well spoken," stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there's a new Rodney on YouTube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet "R.I.P Trayvon Martin"
Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching
Fighting for a freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
"But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talking race, trying to save the fucking globe?"
Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's 1999
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Outro: Evan Roman]
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

[Verse]
Standing outside that venue, passing out fliers
No record labels calling, no buzz, no fire
Burning in my lungs if I kept on writing
One day I'll be discovered and somebody might sign him
Naw, naw, now saying that I'm pop [?]
Before I was on anybody else's iPod
Sleeping on couches and praying to my God
I'm making that money to eat at a IHOP
Give me twenty people, turn them into believers
Booked my own shows in two-hundred-seat theaters
Searched my whole life on this podium, I speak for my hard work
I deserve this arena
When you work your whole life on the verge of defeated
Do it for yourself because nobody out there believed it
Record label, naw, we show the world you don't need 'em
The people want to see change, I so happen to speak it
And me, I'm like, "Who are you?"
God damn it, I'm myself, and I know the truth
And I released that shit when I was in the booth
Shoutout to my family in Syracuse

[Hook]
Everybody say oh-oh! (Oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh! (Oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh!)
Say oh-oh, oh-oh! (Oh-oh, oh-oh!)

[Outro]
It goes, "Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people say true," I said
"Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful, all my people stay true"

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I never won the spelling bee
I could read people's energy
Listen to what have been said to me
Heard the voices in elementary
That I wouldn't amount to anything
Ol' girl, she used to beg to me
Like, if we just had a nice house and a mortgage
And a front lawn, and a fucking wedding ring
I danced in Paris, shed my shell
Swam in oceans, felt the scales
Put my CD in Starbucks, it did not sell
Get the CD out the car trunk and did it myself
These piano keys hold some weight
In a bolo tie, I escort my date
She ordered shrimp scampi on a porcelain plate
The accordion played, I put my fork in a steak
Afternoons need a coffee boost
Attitude needs a confidence boost
Yeah, I'm sort of the dude
But where's the self-esteem when the costumes removed?
Thanks for the invite, can't make it
I could blame it on a flight to Vegas
But, truth be told, rather not socialize
And go and waste my time with an acquaintance
These relationships need maintenance
Everybody got expectations
Text back, so impatient
Where were you when I was an in-patient?

[Hook: Macklemore]
Motherfucker, you ain't my account
You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Man, make better music
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Exactly, I got the man of the year
Source Magazine was like our Vanity Fair
In a mansion, picking out a chandelier
But got a bone to pick with the man in the mirror
Questioning the purchase while I'm standing there
Questioning the purpose of my rap career
Thinking "Man, what the hell happened here?"
Feels like yesterday in a van packing gear
What am I gonna go and give back this year?
There's a whole lot of struggling rappers here
Want a co-sign and a whole track this year
If you know motherfuckers start acting weird
Lot of backstabbers and some actors here
Lot of has-beens and over-reactors here
I remember laughing and cracking beers
Now I climbed the ladder and you're mad I'm here

[Hook: Macklemore (YG)]
Motherfucker, you ain't my account
You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Man, make better music
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
(400)
Motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 3: YG]
Judging me off of my past
You don't see what I'm doing
When I got shot that was headline news
Y'all used me for views, I ain't stupid
Cause what about all the good?
The non-profit for the kids in the hood
That ain't got no option in them shelter homes plotting
Shit, I'm just doing what I should
They must want no one to know
Cause they don't put that on the news, bro
They entertained by the culture, they vultures
They suck us like leeches 'til we broke
But I know the game, so I play it like chess
Act like a square, but really be the threat
The next time my name in the press
Talk about how YG gave them kids Christmas

[Hook: YG]
Motherfucker, you ain't my account
You don't know what I'm doing
Focused on what I'm giving back
Man, make good music
Preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
Motherfucker, I'm gone

[Outro: Macklemore (YG)]
Fuck, hey, woo
Motherfucker, I'm gone
(Four, four, four...)
Hey where'd he go though?
(400)
Motherfucker, I'm gone
(I am the victim not the motherfuckin' suspect)
And he's gone, gone

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Slick shit man, that's all we do
Hold up, little homie, let me talk my truth
Made an Instagram for my cat and my cat doesn't even rap
And got more followers than you
Hold up
Let me get my cat a bar, she's filthy
Hey Cairo come here, baby (Meow)
Now my cat's more famous than you ever will be
I been hustling
Tou can't tell me nothing
I'm Brad Pitt's ugly cousin
But when you're drunk at the wedding (Still gon' fuck him)

[Hook: Xperience]
When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
You got me fucked up
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Like you don't know what's up
Bradley, he's cuzo

[Post-Hook: Xperience]
All my Angelinas
If you got it let me see it
All my Angelinas
If you got it let me see it
All my Angelinas
If you got it let me see it
All my Angelinas
If you got it let me see it

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
You're embarrassed, huh?
I'm in Paris, bruh
You brought your whole crew
I'm with my parents, bruh
Every white dude in America went to the barber shop
"Give me the Macklemore haircut"
Australia, they heard of me
Germany, they heard of me
Japan, they heard of me
It's a murder scene, you gon' learn some things
My dick named Ron Burgundy
I'm bad news with a pan flute
In a plaid suit, no can do
No, uh uh, I don't work for free
I used to smoke that purple weed
Sip a bunch of purple drink
That shit did not work for me
And now I just sip herbal tea
I'm posted at the swapmeet in a robe eating Church's wings
So cold, so cold, no emergen-C

[Hook: Xperience]
When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
You got me fucked up
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Like you don't know what's up
Brad, Brad, Pitt

[Post-Hook: Xperience]
All my Angelinas if you got it let me see it
All my Angelinas if you got it let me see it
All my Angelinas if you got it let me see it
All my Angelinas if you got it let me see it

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Did it by myself, not a little bit of help
Nobody, nobody did nothing, I knelt
On my knees, said "God, please give me a deal"
And God texted me back
"Don't be dumb, young man, gotta do it yourself"
It's up to you to turn the pen into a machete
And make sure that every beat that you meet gets killed
I treat the beat just like a pussy
And I eat it up and beat it up and leave it fucked
So you cannot compete with us
I'm weaving in and out of traffic
In the Cadillac, oh wait, is that us on the radio?
Wait, is that us on the radio?
It's what I always dreamed of
Back when I had peach fuzz
Shoutout to the homie D
Who's D? Deez nuts
I'm eating chicken wings and onions rings
If you're wondering, yes, I does my thing
And another thing, no puppet strings
On the company, we sucker free
I ain't trippin' on what the public think
Ten thousand, we hustling
This shit didn't happen overnight
This shit didn't happen suddenly

[Hook: Xperience]
When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
You got me fucked up
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Like you don't know what's up
Brad Pitt, Brad, Pitt

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I used to work at Subway
Seven bucks an hour wasnt much money
But I be rapping and kicking it on my lunch break
Like I'mma make it out this motherfucker one day
I was in the back, back seat of the bus before a bluetooth
Got the boombox and a blunt, bootlegger deuce-deuce
H on my crew, we get drunk, a little cuckoo
Type of dudes who square up and knock a tooth loose
Quick to the basement, the, the, the basement
That is the window Im planning to vacate with
Pops put on bars just in case somebody breaks in
Thats not gonna stop me from getting to the pavement
Shh, meeting Jerome at the bus stop
I got the bigger roll, paranoid buck cops
And all my citys known for grunge, flannel, puck rock
And a bunch of Sub Pop, I was on that Buckshot

[Hook: (Macklemore)]
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon, we out to bomb
(Buckshot)
Four in the morning I'm with the squad
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon, we out to bomb
Four in the morning I'm with the squad
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Just copped that new Boot Camp tape
The neighbors keep complaining bout too much bass
Bang, bang, let me do my thing
Give me two cans and you gon know my name
You dont want to get involved
You know I be on these overpasses burning bridges, dog
You know I be dippin' through these alleys tryna diss the law
Sixteen with Adidas on
Im too speedy for police Im chiefin' through these streets, Im gone
I got game, dont need to talk anymore
Boppity-bo, tippity-toppity, I pop me some more
I was underground where he came from and he pop out a hole
Cracked the top back on the flat black aerosol
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision
These suit and ties got the nerve to call it vandalism
They hella mad, say my art is really bad for business
But I'mma paint a better world until the cans are empty
Now let it drip, let it drip
If they catch me doing dirt Ill plead the fifth
I pop a top, I bomb the block
Speakers bumpin, I was on that Buckshot

[Hook: (Macklemore)]
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon, we out to bomb
(Buckshot)
Four in the morning I'm with the squad
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go

[Refrain: Samples (KRS-One)]
Chill-chill-chilin' with the crew
Just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
Who-who-who is he?
(Yeah, knowledge reigns supreme)
Got the world following the...

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Turn up the CD or turn up the TV
Turn up your T-A-P-E, turn your phone up, crank up the PC
See, my boys are really beastie if youre talking graffiti
See, we call it aerosol art when we splatter the city
I got twenty five cans in my napsack
Crossing out the whick-whack
T-O-Y-S's aint even get that
Fat tips and black books, yo, we rep that
149th street bench is where we slept at
Clep-clap, clep-clap, clep-clap, clep-clap
Those are not my words, the spray can said that
Where them reds at, or them green turquoise?
Where my real graf writers? Make some noise

[Outro: Samples (KRS-One)]
Chill-chill-chilin' with the crew
Just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
Who-who-who is he?
(Macklemore)
Got the world following the...
Blow blow blow blow blow

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But thats what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Interlude]
And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Macklemore and Ray Dalton]
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Outro *Music Video Ending*]
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph embrace the fight 'cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists
Now let the night come, before the fight's won

Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 1]
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man (awww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a pink palm pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Neighbors keep tripping, I'm like, "I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!"

[Bridge]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massage my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hookah, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty

[Hook]

[Interlude]
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin' eh

[Bridge 2]
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Someone kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Grab your bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
And M.J. was King, and Prince was Prince
And Raven has ruled ever since

[Intro: Macklemore]
And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
We're city kids
You get what you ask for

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

[Hook: Ryan Lewis]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer
At least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days
I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on
Close the chapter
Live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes
But those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality
Rarely lit
Memories, a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors
Graffiti and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain
Some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again
I guess it's relative
The Camel Lights
The whiskey, ryes
Sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second wind
Grow a moustache
Pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

[Hook: Ryan Lewis]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar

[Verse 2: Macklemore and Ryan Lewis]
So here's to the nights
Dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Poor out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real
Even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while
Just to say I visit
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

(i'm fresh...)
(yeah, ryan lewis...)

If it ain't fresh then you ain't gettin' play in my tape deck
Way back, i used to rock the hat with the suede strap at ABC's
Bought my food from the A-rabs
Played craps on corners with the OG slain gat
Uh, cross colours i'm the boss of the playground
I hit you on the nuts cos i know how to play house
The 8-ounce baby from eighty-four then grew up
Cleaner than my Easter suit was with my shoes buffed
Don't step on my new ones
These reeboks beat blocks, you give 'em a few pumps
Baby while you're at it too boo boo
She came from a new school and all i wanna do is my zoom zoom (all I wanna do is my zoom zoom)
My uncle stayed faded like crew cuts
But i was too young to know the what's-what and the who's-who
'round here, they could give a fuck if you got props
You get clowned for rockin' British Knights to the sock hop
The BK stood for "black kids," the hood was crackin
And poison was on everybody's tracklist
Spandex was in fashion, back then
And bad chicks had tracks in that lasted

Before CD's, and internet the kings was in effect
Ya fiends wasn't gettin' respect
[respect...]
Before MP3s and CD-J's we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, I'm fresh
[fresh...]

Let's take it back, b-b-b-back to the days of AC/DC back in black
Gimme a mullet .. a 1984 Chevrolet
Alright I'm lyin' I was listenin' to rap
[ra-rap ra-rap]

Oshkosh bagosh, stone wash, so hard
Overalls hung, one strap on, one off
Eatin' on my cold lunch, grabbin' on both nuts
Mama wanted jerry curl: fuck this bowl cut
Ice cube's got one
Quick in my walkman
Blowin' on the cartridge
Hypercolour: "awesome!"
Cube's in my pocket and i'm outta here I'm bouncin'
And sam goody's not gettin' shit from my allowance

Daydreamin' in class, no i'm zonin' out and
Rosie perez's titties are right where my mouth is
Who says that white men can't jump?.. they were hella wrong!
A'ight they were right, but i was really good at tetherball

Before the days of gettin' drunk at kegs
We were bumpin' some jodicie and dry-humpin' legs
That's right: i was born in the '80s
Pimpin' adventure shrined above my babysitter

House party? crackin
Humpty dance? crackin
Never find the baby: david bowie, labyrinth
Why don't you reminisce and bring it back, rap shit
Dodge caravan, humpin' in the back: classic

Before CDs and internet the kings was in effect
Ya fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before MP3s and CD-Js, we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, i'm fresh
[fresh...]
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1: Xperience]
If it ain't fresh, then you ain't gettin' play in my tape deck
Way back, I used to rock the hat with the suede strap at ABC's
Bought my food from the Arabs
Played craps on corners where the OG's slang at
Cross colors, I'm the boss of the playground
Iesha on the nuts, cos I knew how to play house
The 8 oz. baby from '84 to grow up
Cleaner than my Easter suit was with my shoes buffed
Don't step on my new ones
These Reeboks beat blocks, you give 'em a few pumps
Baby, why your attitude, "boo boo"?
She came from a new school, and all I wanna do is my zoom zoom
My uncle stayed faded like crew cuts
But I was just too young to know the what's-what and the who's-who
'Round here, they could give a fuck if you got props
You get clowned for rockin' British Knights to the sock hop
The BK stood for "black kids," the hood was crackin'
And "Poison" was on everybody's tracklist
Spandex was in fashion, back then
And bad chicks had tracks in that lasted

[Hook]
Before CDs and Internet the kings was in effect
You fiends wasn't gettin' respect
Before mp3s and CD-Js, we pop in a tape cassette
Chain on my chest, I'm fresh

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let's take it back, b-b-b-back to the days of AC/DC, Back in Black
Gimme a mullet, a 1984 Chevrolet
Alright, I'm lying, I was listening to rap
OshKosh B'Gosh, stone wash, so hard
Overalls hung, one strap on, one off
Eatin' on my cold lunch, grabbin' on both nuts
Mom I want a jheri curl, fuck this bowl cut
Ice Cube's got one
Quik in my Walkman
Blowin' on the cartridge
Hypercolor, awesome
Kube's in my pocket and I'm outta here
I'm bouncing and Sam Goody's not getting shit from my allowance
Day dreaming in class, know I'm zoning out and
Rosie Perez's titties are right where my mouth is
Who says that white men can't jump? They were hella wrong!
A'ight, they were right, but I was really good at tetherball
Before the days of getting drunk at kegs
We were bumping some Jodeci and dry-humpin' legs
That's right, I was born in the '80s
Pimpin', adventurous, tryin to bone my babysitter
House party?
Crackin'
Humpty dance?
Crackin'
Never find the baby, David Bowie, Labyrinth
Why don't you reminisce and bring it back, rap shit
Dodge Caravan, humpin' in the back, classic

[Hook: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots
Right now, dance off
Get on the floor
Get on the, get on the floor, go
Get on the floor, do it
Come on and get on the floor, go

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I grab my ankle and pull it up
And do that thing where I move my butt
I got the juice, motherfucker don't use it up
I say woo there it is, then loosen my tux
Then I shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, to the left
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, to the right
Gimme, gimme, gimme, everything that you got
Dance off motherfucker, do the damn thing right

[Interlude 1: Macklemore]
She got loose elbows and a big ol' neck
I like a big boned girl who could work up a sweat
I rock shelltoes and a turtleneck
She just wanna talk, I said, "I ain't TED"
Dance off

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Your grandma, that's a bad mama jama
She doing the banana, grabbing my trunk like a hammock
Mmm, she like the funk, god dammit, she can handle it
She tugging my dick, I'm feeling a little bit inadequate
(Dance off)
Your grandpa got a cock like a ham hock
Hella old, hella long, looking like Matlock
Damn dog, I don't even wanna have a standoff
He drunk talkin' 'bout he 'bout to take his pants off
(Dance off)
The hater with the macarena
I can Roger Rabbit in my office space
If you watch my pace looks like I'm concentrated
Or constipated when I walk this way

[Hook: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots

Rewind
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
(Dance off)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
I sneak up behind you like a panther
Who ordered the private dancer?
Can I get an amen from the pastor?
Pulled the ol' "Do you want a back rub?"
You must hurt like Grey Poupon
Swag on tap like Savion
Jump on the tablecloth, fake a fall
Pretend to break my arm then I'm breaking you off
But please don't tell my babys mama
I wanna dance all night 'til the break of dawn
I wanna sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat 'til your make-up's gone
Baby girl, you looking like a champion

[Interlude 2: Macklemore]
Hey you, you there, get up out of your chair
Paid twenty bucks to get up in this club, put your cellphone down, you square
I be going in, I can't help it, I got bruises on my pelvis
Ladies, fellas, don't drunk dial your ex's
Hello bouncer, I have a job for you
While I'm dancing, watch my shoes
Tonight is the night that we rendezvous
Sweat the fountain of youth, bust a move
Fringe jacket, pants of leather
Tanktop, spandex and pleather
Been a stressful week, I got a lot of pressure
You have a lot of great moves but mine are better

[Hook: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots
Right now, dance off (dance off)
Get down the floor
Get down the, get down the floor, go
Get down the floor, do it
Come on and get down the floor, go

[Post-Hook: Instrumental Breakdown]
Rewind
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Oh Lord, I can't sit down
Better hold my phone, I'm going for the crown, good God
But I'm confident this is my town
Better hope my feet don't fail me now, good God

[Outro: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Get on the floor
Get on the, get on the floor, go

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store with shoppers
Salesman's like, "What up, what's your budget?"
And I'm like, "Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds."
He said, "I got the one for you, follow me."
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal

[Interlude 1: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
I'm headed Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her *** in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'mma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Forget a bus pass, you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derrire
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Hook: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
(Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(Downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs?
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

[Interlude 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Dope
Cut the bull
Get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw
Moped like a bullet
You can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out, "Who that is?"

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, that ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, "You need to slow down!"
"Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill yourself out!
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down!"
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this ish player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

[Hook: Eric Nally]

[Intro: Speaking]
Ladies and gentlemen
Second Thoughts on the beat
Big up to Lace Cadence
Good lookin' out for this one, man

[Verse 1:]
I love hip hop music
I just hate the ego
The politics that follow it
Getting caught in it can be lethal
See I love the community
Cause a community will embrace you
But you turn it back the community is the people that will hate you
See everybody's striving for that same shit
To get paid and make it
And I'll be honest, I'm trying to become famous
When someone makes a move
Watch that person next to you
Cause I'll warn ya
I love Hova but jealousy's The Takeover
Here come the mean mugs
"I can't do what he does"
And where does that lead us?
To the ego that feeds us
I wish that I could just do what I do
But when a door opens for him I'm afraid there won't be enough room
Comparison's a mother fucker
Like MLK said
"We all want that band leader syndrome and it won't stop"
This concept makes me wonder
Is it the commodity of the music or the ego that is killing hip hop?

[Hook:]
It's the ego
That makes me not give respect in death
It's the ego
That makes me talk shit behind people's back
You know that it's the ego
That's constantly polluting my consciousness
So ingrained in my brain that I can barely even acknowledge it
It's the ego
That makes the present moment jet lagged
I said it's the ego
That has me trippin about the next man
You know that it's the ego
That makes me not go to the front
Of the show cause the performers have exactly what I want

[Verse 2:]
I'm so cool
F'real?
No dude, I'm serious spit it different and if you just flow too
I'll listen lookin for glitches and rip 'em to shove improve
That my rhythm's a little bit more intricate, just to boost
My ego
Is so evil
Threatened by so many different kinds of people
It seems that if you're goin' through somethin' and life is feelin' uncomfortable
The immediate place you go is to your ego to comfort you
When Boom Bap got signed
I hated on him
When Grayskul got signed
I hated on him
And that's hard to admit
But since I'm really bein' honest
I wanted to be one of the first to make it as a Northwest rap artist
Instead of takin it as a plus for my region
I took it as a cut to my dreams of makin' it out of this political scene of Northwest haters
To be next I guess I'm just like them
Jealous of who's taking that step

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Now everybody got one but people tryin' to front
Claimin that they on the humble but cocky
Now it comes up when we judge
Or are threatened by someone
But everyone still be like 'man that's not me'
Now let me break it down son
It's only a lack of love for ourselves
Cause we're submerged in 'I gotta be'
The best or number one
But it's just that we don't trust
In our heart and that's what stops me
It's the ego

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The worlds coated in the gold Krylon
Yea, and these days days days
They never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melting
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the bells
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You cant take the band there when youre gone
Ill tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So were feeling like gold
Five hundred thousand sold
Slick rick gold, rope's on, hella cold
Yea were feeling like gold
So fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So were feeling like gold

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Alright now we open up that car door
Hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by sticking out just because
Thats how you illustrate power and who youre above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
Cause tonight we ball, we ball, we comin up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin on the sun

[Hook: : Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toe

Yea were feeling like gold

Oh oh oh oh oh
Today were feeling like gold
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin
Under these gold trunks, thats 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
"Excuse me, thats my bad, thats my eagle and he shouldnt have"
My ego got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And its gold, two girls gold brass
Lounging on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sipping on Orangina, arms around them both pants
Theyre sipping Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl aint even gold, she just got golden girl titties
Im kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it get it get it..

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest "A Raisin in the Sun"
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read "The Alchemist"
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up, ooh
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up

Hey Macklemore can we go thrift shopping
What what what what (x2)
Bada, badada, badada, bada... [x9]

[Hook:]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come-up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1:]
Nah, Walk up to the club like, "What up, I got a soda pop
I'm so pumped about some shit from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty
That people like, "Damn! That's a cold ass honkey."
Rollin' in, hella deep, headin' to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets
(Piiisssssss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in
But me and grungy fuckin it man
I am stuntin' and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No for real - ask your grandpa - can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a kneeboard
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Aw, he got the Velcros"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come-up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-up shirt
'Cause right now I'm up in her stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm not, I'm not sick of searchin' in that section (Uptons)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, second-hand, I rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, "Oh, that Gucci - that's hella tight."
I'm like, "Yo - that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt."
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch (shit)
I call that getting swindled and pimped (shit)
I call that getting tricked by a business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man you hella won't
Man you hella won't
(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah!)

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
I wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this bigg ass
Coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (now come on man)
I'm in this big ass coat (big ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (let's go)

[Hook]
(Little Girl: is that your Grandma's coat hahaha ?)

I'm an Irishman
Leather weathered Irish skin
Beard orange as the sunset over the flag
In the night sky we fly it in
Pride for the life we fight to live
History, I write with it
Spit it with the dialect
And this is a celebration of course
The green, white, orange
And when they pulled up on that shore
First generation born
Toast to those that made it on a boat to New York
And when the English came the colonizer came
They filled up bottles of gasoline, turned 'em into balls of flame
And hurled 'em to protect what's ours
Don't touch these lucky charms
Whole bunch of Irish screaming "Fuck the London Guard"
I'm kidding not dissin' London, it's bloody raw
But go against the Irish and get a bloody jaw
Preaching nonviolence but reminds of the scars
Unify us, put a pint up everybody sing a song

We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

From New England to New Brunswick
Galway to Dublin
A rebellious nation of freckled face hustlers
Heart, blue collared workers and family
My heritage, proud to be a Haggerty
Now with whiskey in our veins
Claiming were the bravest men
I drank Old Crow, but pretended it was Jameson
Dad sipped Guiness, I sipped Old English
'Til he sat me down at 16 and said "boy, this is what a beer is"
I put down the drink, couldn't drink like a gentleman
That doesn't mean I can't make a drinking song for the rest of 'em
Challenge us in football, yeah we might lose
But don't put us next to a bar stool
We take the history, script it in song
Light the torch then you pass it on
That's right I said, lineage through the rhythm we script it from the palm
And we give til' Ireland is on
Bottoms Up

We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya

We put our glass to the sky and lift up
And live tonight 'cause you can't take it with ya
So raise a pint for the people that aren't with us

Tonight, we're celebrating life
Those are all my Irish goons in the background
Put 'em up!
Because you know
All the way from Ireland
To the States
From Dublin to Boston
Grafton to Seattle
My whole Haggerty family
This one's for you
Let's go
And all my people say (hey!)
All over the world
Even if you're not Irish
Put your glasses up
Ryan Lewis and all my people say
That's Ireland
It's beautiful isn't it?
Irish celebration
And all my people say

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

Im taking it, taking it, they aint giving it
Im taking it, taking it, they aint giving it
Im taking it, taking it, they aint giving it
Im taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
If I just went in and stole it, the police would have noticed
Gotta be strategic, creep it, go in, leave without motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, casing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions (millions)
Headed in sweating, open that front door
"Interscope" printed out right by the entrance
Door closes, not a metaphor
Then I start towards that front desk, right where you check in
Dressed in a uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, rush in
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador ("Fuck you!")
Carrying two cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor I'm late, paintin' Jimmy Iovine's office
Holding my breath 'bout to faint
Im scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud that you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I dont make it out
Then I'm leaving town with that contract
And I'm spazzing out, grabbing the A&R out
His chair and I'm taking him hostage
I don't give a fuck, step into the elevator, press "3"
Now I'm headed up ("Heist!")
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And Im ready and willing to bust 'em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers go ahead, and then gives me a wink

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it

I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I made it past security, the secretary, the cubicles
But its weird, its like this room Ive walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, its got the vibe of a funeral
Theres numbers on a chalkboard
CDs boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin' that they have nobody in house
Wonderin what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yeah, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven-sent
Big, block, silver letters, read it out loud, "President" ("Heist!")
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck

He said, "Weve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music, it's so impressive, and this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you're destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous
Now Im sorry, Ive had a long day, remind me now what your name is?
Thats right, 'Macklemore,' of course... today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? Well give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out, well need back that money that you borrowed"

"So its really like a loan?"

"A loan?! Come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
You'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when youre out doing your shows
Manager gets twenty, booking agent gets ten
So shit, after taxes, you and Ryan have 7% to split!
Thats not bad, Ive seen a lot worse
No one will give you a better offer than us"

"Mm-hm," I replied, "I appreciate the offer"
Thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist
Than succeed at getting fucked
<END TEXT>
[Intro]
OK, OK
Yeah
We live tonight
Check it, now

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I seen pain, I felt the losses
Attended funerals and seen coffins
21 years old, an angel was lost here
Wings clipped by the grip of 80 milligram sniffs of oxycontin
Everyday through the nostrils
Never went away, never does it stop there
Death a line or two away and a couple tall cans
Cause you never know when God is gonna call, man
Precious, what we all share
I said peace at 5:30, the next time that I saw him was in the hands of the pallbearer
What if I would've never gone and dropped him off there?
Blaming myself, in hysterics, screaming "It's not fair!"
21 years old with a book of rhymes he was gonna recite to the globe
Only thing to numb the pain besides that shit in his nose
He was gonna quit tomorrow, we're all gonna quit tomorrow
Just get us through the weekend, and then Monday follows
Then it's Wednesday, then it's "fuck it, I'm already feeling hollow"
Might as well go crack a seal and might as well go chug a bottle
Might as well go pop a pill and go and band-aid that problem
And escape this world, vacate this world
Cause I hate myself
No praying's gonna cure this pain

[Hook: Leon Bridges]
Doctor, please, give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room and something ain't right
All this is on you, we're over-prescribed

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
For me and Kev
He went up in jail, institutions are dead
And with our lives, we play Russian Roulette
And try to find a life where we could be content
Cause for us, we're just trying to minimize the fear of being alive
And now my little brother is in the sky
From a pill that a doctor prescribed
That a drug-dealing billion dollar industry supplied
And the cops never go and profile at night
Yeah, the, the, the orange plastic with the white top they sell to you
Has us looking for the answers and that instead of you
Quick fix, whatever'll do
We just gonna neglect the truth
Because a doctor with a license played God and said it's cool
Played God and said it's cool
But me? I don't blame Kev or his mom freebasing while pregnant with him
I blame the pharmacy companies
And country that spends trillions fighting a war they supplying themselves
Politicians and business and jail
Public defenders and judges who fail
Look at Kevin, look at Kevin
Now he's wrapped in plastic
First dealer was his mom's medicine cabinet
Got anxiety, better go and give him a Xanax
Focus, give him Adderall, sleep, give him Ambien
'Til he's walking 'round the city looking like a mannequin
Ups and downs, shooting up prescriptions you're handing him
So America, is it really worth it? I'm asking you

[Hook: Leon Bridges]
Doctor, please, give me a dose of the American Dream
Put down the pen and look in my eyes
We're in the waiting room and something ain't right
All this is on you, we're over-prescribed

[Outro: Leon Bridges]
Doctor, your medicine and your methods
Can't cure my disease without killing me
You're killing me, you're killing me
You're killing me, you're killing me
Doctor, your medicine and your methods
Can't cure my disease without killing me
You're killing me, you're killing me
You're killing me, you're killing me

[Sampled Hook: Win Butler of Arcade Fire]
In the darkest of days
Men become kings and still die of old age
While the children become gods
At last the whole world begins to play

[Verse 1: Buffalo Madonna]
My body is adorned with thorns
King with a crown of thorns
I wash my feet and kiss the ground I'm on
I wash my feet kiss the ground I'm on, I'm on
Jump niggas cos they thought I was a pawn
But knowing I'm a king, I'm about to get on
This the sirens for the quiet of the storm
Ring that alarm, r-r-ring that alarm
Yo, her body was adorned, adorned
And I adored her, so much that I had to ignore her
Her body I explored it, like an explorer
Her first name was Dora, her first name was Dora
I opened up the door and saw
My queen getting raw, getting raw
So like me beating, Resevoir Dog
Had to hit it raw, no not raw, dog
I was a hog, but I don't eat the pork
She was a swine, crippling' my time
On the cast of my pearl, yo she wasn't my girl
This wasn't reality, this wasn't my world
Like Jimi or Kurt before
King with a crown I shall be adored
Even if I have, always been ignored
I was not the norm I will not be ignored

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Champagne Champagne]
Young world, this the story of the kings
A nigga couldn't decide should I rap or should I sing
And since God blessed me with my wings
I'm like a lil' nappy-head Bill Russell with the rings, feel me?
Lately globetrotting through a lotta traps
Friends become rats, I'm talkin Judas in expensive slacks
Fuck 'em, to tell the truth now, I'm over that
Sucker'll be suckers, it don't matter that you roll with pack
I steady grab my nuts and you can roll with that
Pardon my back, and the weight on my shoulders, black
History's on my side, these niggas hard in they cars
But in the streets they can't look me in the eye
Look me in the eye, look me in the eye
Champagne Champagne

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
(Can I get 'em?)
Stand like a man, move like a legend
Talk but with action, that's how you'll be remembered
The greats learned that humility is a weapon
Sever ties with the part of you too big to learn a lesson
Sit in silence, to fight the mind and try to find the present
Cos we only get a couple chances to be epic
And I'm connected, like God plugged my headphones
Directly into Heaven and told me to go and get 'em with this
Mic cord, I am, nothing you can tell me
They bark when they talk, but they walk like the legless
The purpose of my art is for people to respect me
I'm not a king, I'm a servant to the desires that tempt me
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Be Emir to the people when they're searching for truth
Only way to escape the cage in a valley of roots
Claim the mirror, my people, keep searchin for you

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I woke up, threw some sweat pants on
Then I fed my cat and then I walked to the mini mart
And I really want a donut, shouldn't get a donut
Bought a donut, fuck it man it's really hard
Supposed to be on a diet, I wanna be like Ryan
He lost thirty pounds on that paleo
But fuck it man I love fried shit
I was gonna get skinny for the summer
I was gonna start doing my crunches
But looking down at my stomach
I'ma go to the beach, but I'm not taking my shirt off in public
My girl shaped like a bottle of Coke
Me? I'm shaped like a bottle of nope
I'd like to order a hot dog, some bon bons
A large soda, and some tacos to go

[Interlude: Macklemore]
I never knew what a carbohydrate was
Turns out that it's all the snacks I love

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I wanna be like Hugh Jackman, you know jacked man
With a really huge package
I wanna be the 2015 Batman
And send Ben Affleck packing
If you ain't gonna treat Jennifer Garner right
You don't deserve to have that
You better pass that to the homie Matt Damon
He'd eat the booty like Pac Man
(Pac Man)

[Chorus: Xperience]
You know I feel good about this place
You know I feel good about this steak
You know I feel good about this shake
You know I feel good about these plates
You know I feel good about these crepes
You know I feel good about this cake
You know I just love how it tastes
I'm not gonna wait, I'm not tripping about my weight, no

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Happy New Years
Everybody got a resolution
But the next day, we forget about it, never do 'em
I went to the gym and got a membership
Five minutes on the treadmill and I never lift
That was four years ago I should probably cancel this
But they tell me I gotta do it in person, ain't that a bitch?
But tomorrow though, I'ma get fit
Get me a fuel band and a fit-bit
Get me some workout shoes, and a bench press
Some Lulu Lemons and a french press
I'ma finally focus, do some private yoga
Exercise my shoulders, I'ma hide the donuts
Realign my posture, no time for sofas
I'm finally sober, no lime Coronas
But again, that's tomorrow
And today, man, I gotta go in cause it's my last day
Before I lose that weight, I gotta get one last plate and go big
I ate all night, Kool-Aid on ice
I woke up and I felt like shit
And I said, "You know what, man, fuck it
I should probably start on Monday instead"
Motherfucker let's eat

[Chorus: Xperience]
You know I feel good about this place
You know I feel good about this steak
You know I feel good about this shake
You know I feel good about these plates
You know I feel good about these crepes
You know I feel good about this cake
You know I just love how it tastes
I'm not gonna wait, I'm not tripping about my weight, no

[Verse 1]
I don't know why
But it's like I can't stay quiet
This is my voice
I can't let it die inside me
See I'll be scared if there wasn't a riot
Pushing and pulling, grabbing some hair
Puking and fucking up the sidewalk
This battle makes it interesting
I abide desires
Like a dog pissing on the hydrant
Just to spite the fire
It's not to be taken lightly
The page is a set of eyelids
The booth is an instrument that God created
To record us trying to find him
But don't let the word throw you off
Religion and spirit are two different plots
Just know that it's bigger than me and my ego
When I'm flyin
Take me higher
I've got something to pray for
Please leave me when I'm guided
Who said that "Life is cinema"?
This is epic, be present
I'm right here

Selfish, selfish, selfish me, yeah, me, yeah
Girlfriend, break-up, new one, one-night stand, cheat, cheat, repeat that
Drug use, clean up, drug use, drug use, clean up, drug use, rehab
Fuck you, I suck dude, self-loathing, self-esteem, ego, then me again
Put a soundtrack right in the middle
A neverending quest to try and get fans
There you have the beginning, a middle and a really shitty end
Nah, give me a break through, can I get a montage, come on I need that
Humble me, give me a conflict, a hardship, let me break through this cement
They're gonna be so disappointed when they roll the credits and
I realize that my movie sucked and I was the only one that could edit it
Well the course, the chain of events, that would be the evidence, some say it's coincidence
I say I found something greater than myself and started accepting it
And I can see, feel, taste and smell again
And I'm the only one with the hammer to break this shell I'm in
It's gonna take me crackin' this mirror to finally be myself again
Met my potential a long time ago and I'm not stopping til I resemble him

(I got soul but I'm not a soldier...)

[Hook: Mike Slap]
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
In the back of a town car, staring at myself in a tux
Maneuvering through the people out front
Police barricade, orange cones and we're stuck
Twenty minutes late and my manager blowing me up
Security guard in the garage at the entrance
We roll down the window and show him our credentials
Terrell flash the pass and he lets us continue
Metal detectors, phone losing reception
I should be grateful this my nine to five
I walk into the green room, alright, alright
I get on YouTube tryna learn how to tie on my tie
Fuck it, I'll wear the bolo tonight, night, night
I probably shouldn't have done the drugs I've done
A couple of days ago, detox son
I forgot my belt at the hotel
Fuck, now my team all scrambling to help, this sucks
I need something to cope, ain't nothing to cope
I eat  a banana and I drink a cup of Throat Coat
I wish I had the homies with me here but nope
Most of the artists that I know don't get invited to this show
Because success to them determines our value
The make-up, the power, hairspray, perfume, makeup and powder
The ratings come down to who's popular now in the song in the hour
Knock at the door, I let them in, hair and makeup now, red carpet in ten
She covers up my freckles, concealer on my chin
I look orange but she swears it looks natural with my skin
The show is starting, they take me to my seat
Walk in the arena, feel the ego of elites
Like the whole industry is staring at me
A row away from Taylor, two away from Jay and Bey

[Hook: Mike Slap]
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Curtain opens up, host walks out
We stand in unison and applaud real loud
I watch the other people that have been around for a while
Just excited I got invited, feeling cool in the crowd
Thinking such and such is bold, look at such and such's gold
Damn, such and such in real life, looks really fuckin' old
Such and such is fine, she's with such and such, oh
I'm here but I'm barely even watching the show
Cause tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
I said tonight we toast to our accomplishments
Insecurity dressed up as confidence
An award is given out, commercial, reset the scene
They keep saying "Coming soon is the Biebs"
Watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities
It feels so make believe
They want the gossip, they want the drama
They want Britney Spears to make out with Madonna
They want Kanye to rant and to go on longer, cause that equates to more dollars
They want talking topics, they want trending topics
They want outfits to be outlandish, they want sideways glances
Beef and problems, they want nipple slips
Cause they live for clicks, this is economics
So we Botox our skin and we smile for the camera
Might as well get a new nose while we're at it
This is America, insecurity's our fabric
And we wear it and we renamed it fashion
I look to my right, there's a cameraman snapping
Picture after picture after sister after sister
Of the line of Kardashians, mind so distracted
Realized there's an ovation and everyone's clapping

[Hook: Mike Slap]
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
It's just weird when the camera's on you
Gotta remember to still clap if I lose
I see myself up on the screen
Split into five different artists on TV
And just look normal, don't get turned into a meme
Relax, breathe
(And the award goes to: Macklemore and Ryan Lewis)
Me
There's a stranger holding my award
I give her an awkward hug she says "It's yours"
Think I'm supposed to kiss her on the cheek
Man, I should have prepared an acceptance speech
Do I talk first? Is it Ryan? Is it me?
Fuck it, I'll take the lead, grab the mic, say my piece
Do I look at camera one? Do I look at camera three?
I promise, I'm honored, I'd like to thank God, my momma and father
I'd like to thank Tricia, the mother of my daughter
I couldn't have done it without you all in my corner
Especially the fans, been here since the beginning
Supported the music, allowed us to be independent
And I know, I shouldn't be long-winded
Wait, hold up, don't play the music, let me finish
This feels so narcissistic, dressed as a celebration to conceal it's a business
Me, me, me, my, my image, my, my songs, my self interest
One big reality show that is scripted
And I can keep trying or get off the competition
I'd rather run out of my fifteen minutes
Than have life past me by and I forget to live it
But that doesn't mean retirement
But I don't like who I am in this environment
I forgot what this art's for
I didn't get through Freshman year to drop out as a Sophomore
Here I am in this arena, yeah, I'm scared
I got the people's attention, don't wanna lose it here
Thinking about my career, miserable here
But wanna make sure I'm invited next year
To the same damn party, celebrities and aisles
Same blank stares, same fake smiles
Same big budget production
I know now who I am when the lights go out and it falls down
And the curtain closes, nobody notices
Wanted to throw up the Roc, wanted to be Hova
Wanted to be Wayne with the accent from the 'Nolia
Thought I'd feel better when the award show was over
But I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Just in time, what will I say?
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made
I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Just in time, what will I say?
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made

[Verse 1]
Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd done it for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

[Verse 2]
Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego once swollen until karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, necklace
What I really need is a job off CraigsList
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, Twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track

[Hook]

Forget about the fame
I said forget about the fame
I'll forever remain faithful
Stay true, stay true, stay true

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I used to sit with my dad in the garage
That sawdust, that Pinesol, and the moss
Around every spring, when the winter thawed
Wed huddle around the radio, twist the broken knob
710 AM, no KJR. Dave Niehaus' voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldnt have been older than 10
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been Gods
1995, the Division Series
Edgar's up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning
Got the whole town listening
"Swung on and belted," the words distorted. "Joey Cora rounds third!
Here comes Griffey! The throw to the plates not in time!
My, oh my, the Mariners win it!"
Yes. Fireworks, they lit up that ceiling in the Kingdome
We had just made history

[Interlude: Dave Niehaus]
"Swung on and lined down the left field line for a base hit! Here comes Joey! Here comes Junior to third base! Theyre gonna wave him in! The throw to the plate will be late! The Mariners are going to play for the American League Championship! I dont believe it! It just continues! My, oh my!"

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Laces woven, barely holdin that stitch
The creases of time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field, with that sun-stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back with me and my crew
Sunburnt arms
Big League Chew
Yeah we were like, The Sandlot after dinner
After practice we'd listen
To the Ms in the kitchen
And if mom wasnt trippin
"Come on dad! Please, I swear, just one more inning!"
Voice went "pump, pump!" through the system
"Break out the rye bread! It's grand salami time!"
"My, oh my! Another victory!"
Yes. My city, my city
Childhood, my life watchin Griffey right under those lights

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Under that light rain, gleaming in that night game, can't stop now
Keep moving, no brake pads!
Came here to prove a point, live my life on the field
Make history in between the base paths
And compete against the fear that is in me thats my only barrier and I swear that I'mma break that!
From the mud
The cleats that we drug
Through the feet
This is that moment, and you can't take it back
I dont really collect cards anymore, just a box and some old cardboard
Memories embedded in the dust, in the fibres that age just like us
Livin somewhere off in the drawer
This is what you make of it. Yeah, we play to win
Live it like were under the lights of the stadium
Fight until the day that God decides to wave us in
Right, until he waves us in
Its my city, my city, childhood, my life. Thats right
Under those lights
My city, my city, childhood, thats right. Niehaus, "My, oh my!"
Come on. My city, my city, childhood, my life. Thats right, under those lights
It's my city, my city, childhood, my life, Niehaus. My, oh my. Rest in peace

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Washing out cigarettes in the bathroom
Should probably only give my opinion when I'm asked to
I'm really good at telling the half truth
But usually only when I have to
The money doesn't work, the chain doesn't work
Something broken in my brain, got me praying in the dirt
Got me stranded in my bed, like I'm laying in the hearse
And the grass is always greener when you play on Astroturf
Wonder why my generation poppin' pills and poppin' percs
And got some weed and got some purp
And got some bars and got some syrup
And got some Jordan's on my feet
I went and matched them with my shirt
And I just Instagramed them both
To show you that I got them first
Got a Louis duffel bag, I got my girl a purse
I'm tryna find God through a purchase
I'm not tryna go to church
Amen, Satan told me not to serve
I only think about myself
I only think about my work
I only think about my come-up: capitalism
Look at where we come from
We are what we run from
We are why we smoke some
So numb, so numb, so numb

[Hook: Macklemore & Chance The Rapper]
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Macklemore]
I cry when she smile with her eyes closed
I'm already afraid of tight clothes
Want all her best friends to be white folks
I scratched out this line so many times, I can't forget it
It's fucked up, I almost say it every time that I edit
I swear rapping make it easy to lie
But secrets don't make it easy to write
I met the Devil in Manhattan, quickly ended discussion
I don't need a thing, he warned of repercussions
But I know he come in all forms, that won't be his last visit
Time is moving fast and I'm running with a pair of scissors
Looking in the mirror like, "Damn, that ain't my dad, is it?"
He handed the torch but he ain't hold my hand in it
I spent a pretty penny on microphones, mini-midis
In-ears and CDs, I put the indie in Windy City
Indian giver, black father, white liar
Right next to Yeezy like Mike Myers
Stare at the cue cards, take out the juke parts
Take out the God references, just leave the cool parts
I remember opening for Ben, wasn't no liquor at the show
And now the white girls call me nigga at my show
I wish I could open twice, sit down at the open mic
Go back to the day before I became famous over night
I wish I could open twice, sit down at the open mic
Go back to the day before I became famous over night

[Hook: Macklemore & Chance The Rapper]
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear

Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Uh-huh, um, 1-2
Now 'round here they sing broken hymns
Their prayers flow better when they're soaked in gin
The amp's dusty and sits in the corner
By a bartender thatll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox thatll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
Theres a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I dont cover it up
Rusted faces, familiar places
Even if they havent left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth thats so strong Id be a fool not to chase it
But yea, Im a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems drown themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it, a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and Ill be right back

[Hook: Allen Stone]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But Ive misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the church is
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, all the Lord Have Mercys
Blessed in holy water, the sin, oh Holy Father
Have you ever smelled flesh that sweats out Monarch vodka?
11 AM in the morning and you cant get it off ya
Calling to the preacher but its like the pastor isnt talking
Until the store opens and I can re-up on that doctrine
The people close to me say that Im in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This is the drink of the Lord, thats according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if youre judging it I dont want it
I got sins that scald like my throat when I hit the bottle
And Im sinking and thats why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, far more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, Im getting amnesia
Shaking til Id get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

[Bridge: Macklemore]
Wouldnt miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the Neon Cathedral

[Bridge: Macklemore]

[Hook: Fences]
Oh girl, this boat is sinking
There's no sea left for me
And how the sky gets heavy
When you are underneath it
Oh I want to sail away from here
And God, he came down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
And said nothing

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on
He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?
That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh
And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard
Yup, yup he had five a bone
When he passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hot box, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddam, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healing
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching
Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous
Room spinning
Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutching that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up

He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us

[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the Feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talking about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declining record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pain
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know cause he's my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit
Pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feeling like a failure
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parent's basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And "Weed's not a drug," that's denial
Groundhog Day, life repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them
We used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheating and lying
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinking I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was going to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay
Cause I could draw, my uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math
Like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league"
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw, nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause; progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And she's like, "Can you undo my bra strap?"
I try to play it cool, in my head I'm like, "Aw yeah!"
Then she's like "I'm tired" and I'm like "Aw, man"
I was 'bout to crush the coochie like a tall can (Yeah)
Cause my girl's thick (thick!), she got a booty mane
And a big old belly looking like Gucci Mane
I keep my jewelry on, she love my dookie chain
Cause guess what! (what?) That's my boo boo thang. (who?)
My boo boo thang. (who?) My boo boo thang
She get too comfortable, bathroom door open when she boo boo-ing
I whisper in her ear, "Are you awake?"
Kissed her on her neck, said "Good night. You my babe."

[Chorus: Ryan Bedard]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Me and you, let's get lost in these bed sheets
At the very least press my D against your left cheek
She said Fifty Shades of Grey was the best read
I'm more of a Giving Tree type of guy, Shel Silverstein (He's awesome)
She keeps talking, might as well be in a seminar
I'm stuck, completely numb in my left arm
Her knees are bony, I need my homies
And that sounds weird, but I need my homies. (YUP)
You watched ahead on the fourth season of Game of Thrones? (Aw hell nah!)
I hold that against you (hmm mm!)
I want to forgive you, but inside I'm resentful
With your lame claims that we had different schedules! (we didn't!)
I've seen your Netflix queues, you're busted!
Can I even trust you, do you even know what love is?!
She put her hand on my D and started to rub it
All a sudden I succumb, say "Fuck it" and then busted (sleep tight)

[Chorus: Ryan Bedard]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Don't trip girl, you know I got you
Let's take it all off, no costumes
See I'm a man, but every now and then in bed I know when to say: "Alright, it's my turn to be the small spoon."
But tonight, I put my hands around your waist
Feel those little prickly hairs that you missed shaving your legs and say, "Good night my love, it's been one hell of a day."
And you reply, "I'm sleeping... space"

[Outro: Macklemore]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me
Spoon me

[Verse 1]
I think happiness went that away
Sometimes you just have to wait
I never believed in God
But things got so fucked up
That I had to pray
Used to steal my Daddy's Cabernet
Never thought that it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin', everything will be all right
If we could get through the week
Maybe see another Saturday
Rollin' round, we know where to go
Argue with the homies over who's gonna roll
Bumpin' Goodie Mob, have some food for the soul
Till it's two in the morn'
When rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothing really is a big deal
One hand on the steering wheel
And we gon' be all right

[Verse 2]
I had a brown paper bag
St. Ides in that motherfucker
Around the city we smash
5-0 comin' then you know I'm running
Crawl into broken fences, when shit gets hard
You know who your friend is
And when I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Looking at the satellites pass by
Reflecting on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Another morning, swearing it's the last time
Where would I be?
We can't start over, you don't get a new ID
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean the motherfucker get to dance with me

[Verse 3]
I bought a house, second guessing what I own now (What?)
Traffic moving kinda slow now (What?)
I watch the population grow wild (What?)
A bunch of people I don't know now (What?)
My city's changed and my zoned out
I thought about New York, maybe SoCal
Put up condos people can't afford now
Landmarks bulldozed, been tore down
Overpopulated but can seem like a ghost town
Keep a couple real ones with me when it goes down
Lack of diversity, I think about Sloane now
Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
If I still drink, I would crack a 40 ounce
Parents finally left, moved away, and they sold the house
It's really hard to ignore it now
Wish that we could sort it out
Last couple sips, pour it out
St. Ides

[Intro: Macklemore]
1,2, now

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Those three-plus years, I was so proud of
Then I threw them all away for two Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that "He lied to me"
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fucking privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
A "08/10/08" that now has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box as a saint
That I never was, just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
What the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know, what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look at him directly into his face
Deceit on your shoulders, deceivingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built has been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth and be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up, given props, loved and praised
I guess, I gotta get this on the page
Feeling sick and helpless
Lost the compass where self is
I know what I've gotta do, and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em, yeah
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them

[Hook: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought youd gone, but you were with me all along, along

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober, I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the East Side, shaking, tweaking
Hope that they don't see it, hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed, shooken
If they call on me I'm passin', if they talk to me I'm booking
Out that door, but before, I can make it
Somebody stops me and says "Are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time, I just wanted to say that
If it wasn't for 'Otherside,' I wouldn't have made it"
I just looked down at the ground and say, "Thank you"
She tells me she has nine months, and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry, fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I want to tell her I relapsed, but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her, "Congrats"
Get back to my car, and I think I'm tripping, yeah
Cause God wrote "Otherside," that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man, I fucked up
Like so many others, I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good

[Bridge: Macklemore]
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

[Hook: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought youd gone, but you were with me all along, along

"Alright baby girl, lets sing to it."

[Pre-Verse 1]
You're getting your degree, you're going to college
I'm making music and hoping that Kanye puts me on
But If I don't make it baby, would you be mad at me?
If I just chilled at home as your stay-home-daddy?

[Verse 1]
Come on, I'll make you coffee (coffee), and a bagel (bagel)
And another bagel (two bagels)
Keep on reading that paper, then it's off you go
"Hun, you're gonna be late
Don't forget your briefcase, drive safe" ("Peace, babe")
Wake up the kids, toast the toast, put the Raisin Bran up in the bowl
The toast.. did I forget the toast?
The toast is toast, dammit, I burnt the toast
Start crying, the kid's like, "Dad, what's wrong?"
"Oh, it's not you, kids, it's just me, I'm alone
Papa's a little bit stressed out... fuck!"
Feeling so sensitive, I'm going for a latte
See what's popping at pilates
Hit up my friends like, "Yo, what up man, tryna have a spa day?"
"The fuck? You're a stay at home dad, that's not gay!"

[Hook]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, you go to work, I mow the lawn
Ay, ay, ay, ay, you make the cheese, I'll bring the guac (nacho sauce, Spanish)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, you buy the clothes, I'll take them off ("JNCOS! FUBU!")
Ay, ay, ay, ay, I'm a stay at home dad, this is my job

[Pre-Verse 2]
You go girl, get that promotion
I'll be on the sofa, collecting unemployment
Yelling at the T.V., watching Maury Povich
Quit groping that girl, Maury Povich

[Verse 2]
Who is this Jenny Jones bitch?
Shit, it's four o'clock, time for Oprah (Oprah!)
The gospel of the Lord, for dads who stay at home
Even though we can't get boners
We still watch Rachael Ray and Emeril cook lasagna
Swooping up the kids from soccer practice (soccer practice)
Then time for gymnastics, Rice Crispy treats and wax baggies
I'm with my kids in the minivvan, listening to NPR
With the windows down, through the cul de sac

Then it's homework time, dinner time, set the placemats
Cook, clean, tuck the rugrats in blankets
Then I lay you down, pop two Cialis, put on Sting
And then go quench my palette
Is that douche, or does your cooch just smell like flowers?
Your feet are calloused, peppermint towlette
Jasmine pedicure? Scented oil, homeopathic backrub?
I am Alladin, your carpet is magic, your wish has been granted
I would just love to ride your carpet out of the palace
Now keep on bringing the green, baby, and I'll keep on tossing salad

[Hook]

[Outro]
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have been conditioned to believe we must fit in a role, brainwashed by Babylon. Depicting our role must match our genitalia, hell to the no. It's men who go to work, and women raise the children, but I know the hardest job is maintaining the household, so I am doing a back-to-back, no tradebacks, with this briefcase. For 2010, I am staying at home."
<END TEXT>
I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of pitchfork cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right out of your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Amen, regardless I'mma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
About damn time that I got out of my basement
About damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell, David Bowie meets Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousands hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousands hands, they carry me

Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'mma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat 'em
Celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage I'm actually working on leaving
See, I observed Escher
I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring
You see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great cause they paint a lot
I will not be a statistic
Just let me be
No child left behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system, what did you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousands hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousands hands, they carry me

Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it, no light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart no substitute
Banging on table tops, no substitute
I'm feeling better than ever man, what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth...

It's the part of the show
Where it all fades away
When the lights go to black
And the band leaves the stage
And you wanted an encore
But there's no encore today
Cause the moment is now
Can't get it back from the grave

Part of the show
It all fades away
Lights go to black
Band leaves the stage
You wanted an encore
But there's no encore today
Cause the moment is now
Can't get it back from the grave

Welcome to the heist
Welcome to the heist...

[Verse 1]
Came in together, but you held me
The process walking right through that door, at the entry
I cant seem to remember, the lights were so bright
And the disco ball blurred in the turn of that night
But it was perfect, I was told the tux was starched and all
Grabbed the glass of punch, nervousness struck, stood by that wall
Arms folded, myself, I didnt know yet
Until you came over, stood by me, you posted
You put your hand out like I was stranded
Tried to pull me on that dance floor, I stepped backwards
See I wasnt ready yet, but you were my medicine..
Showed me that trust through that love that you held me with
Our backs against the wall as the DJ would spin
The soundtrack had changed as he played that mix
Our lives flashed in front of us, just a glimpse
We were together and experience this

[Verse 2]
You finally pulled me up, I didnt want to
But you filled me up, from the bottom of my heart
And as we walked through that gymnasium that Id been watching
Feeling like my chest would explode from my heartbeat
To the middle of the floor I almost panicked
You put your hand out and I fearfully grabbed it
The most beautiful thing that Id seen on this planet
She laughed cause you could tell that I didnt know how to dance yet
We started moving and I didnt know what I was doing
You whispered, "Dont you love music?
Its such a gift and Ill give it to you
But you gotta use it
I strayed, you brought me back in
Trying to sneak a flask outside of that gym
She said "You dont need that, look within"
She hugged me, looked into my eyes, she gave me a kiss
And she said, "I cant help you, if you dont let me
Youre here to live, just be, dont forget me
The end of this dance you dont want to regret me, live
Cos tonight you'll all be set free"

[Verse 3]
"Last dance!" the DJ yelled
Looked into her eyes and I could see myself
Slow motion, frozen, toast to this moment
Like there is no morning, like there is no morning
No emotions, you on my shoulder, me lead and you follow
As we circle the floor like the globe through this infinite mass
Makes us seem so small
With you in my hand like the skyline holds the stars
Not letting go, but I cant hold on
Fading through my fingertips, watching us fall
I try to catch you with my arms
I would never take you for granted when I had you in my palms
To all I ever wanted, please play my song
And put the record to the needle, dont ever touch that off switch
You are perfect, forget that prom dress
My God, seconds away from God, yes
Somebody turned the heat on in this party
Or were becoming one because Im melting into your body
One being, heart beating, universe falling
The ground split right between us and that concrete
Separated my love, I could hear her calling
Separated, but I could hear her calling
Goodbye forever, never see you again

[Verse 1]
Where the hell did soul go?
I am not the logo
Been here too long and I'm going home
Airplane mode, better hold the phone, better hold the phone
I woke up this morning, I looked in the mirror
Cold feet on the tile, how the hell am I here?
Lost track of the moment, barely remember the year
Is this a higher calling or just a career?
Oh god, I'm lost, my bad, my fault
And "I'm sorry" doesn't cover all the pain that I've caused
Just wanna love myself, not codependent on applause
Just wanna run myself, not codependent on applause

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to work, nah
I just wanna play
I just wanna stay in bed
And watch life through the shades
Through the shade
I just wanna feel better, feel better
And I don't wanna wait, no
I just wanna be happy, man
Man, I'll open up the shades
Open up the shades, open up the shades

[Verse 2]
I wish that taro cards would tell me my future
They say faith is good only if you use it
My uncle's kidneys failed when he got out the hospital
But he stayed drunkaholic, he just couldn't get off that bottle
Couldn't get off that bottle
I went to the casino, swore I ain't going back
The next day, went to the ATM and bet it on black
I spun the roulette wheel and I felt it all start to crash
Playing cards with the Devil, we all know the dealer wins that
I got too much bad karma, yeah, I shoulda saved up
Got kicked off that ladder I was finally getting praise from
A chance to see how we react when God decides to break us
Once you pick the pieces up, well then it's time to make something
I wanna get high, just wanna stay up
Chipped my teeth on the curb
Fight, fuck and make up
Wanna escape my mind, these thoughts need vacations
And girl, you look good, but you'd look better in Jamaica

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to work, nah
I just wanna play
I just wanna stay in bed
And watch life through the shades
Through the shade
I just wanna feel better, feel better
And I don't wanna wait, no
I just wanna be happy, man
Man, I'll open up the shades
Open up the shades, open up the shades
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Pretty face tryna chase the train
And I could look the other way but it still won't erase the pain
And I pray that she stay the same, amazing grace
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just another reflection in the window
Watchin' the trees pass by at a tempo
Got a round trip ticket out to limbo
And I'm getting close to my kinfolk
I'm sorry that you didn't get the memo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Water under burned bridges
Always on the road tryna earn a livin'
I remember when I bought my first ticket
I've been going, haven't turned back since then
This return day must be a misprint
Made a wrong turn now I'm long distance
And I miss them

[Hook: Carla Morrison]
Otra ciudad, otra vida, otra, otra ciudad, ah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I try to write but every sentence is a run on
I try to text you but I don't get reception in this tunnel
Vision, visit only for a minute
I'm gettin' on track but the wheels still spinnin'
You can see the smoke in the distance, it billows
Roll up my sweatshirt, turn it into a pillow, ay
I got a polaroid camera so I don't forget where I travel
I got a couple rolls of film I'll get developed when I get back to Seattle
I told momma that I'd call her, talked for a couple minutes
But I didn't
I miss my brother, feel disconnected
Wanted to stay, wanted to catch the next one
I wanted to talk, just me and him
Because I had some things I felt I had to tell him
When you're always runnin', tryna make a connection
It's almost impossible to stay connected
When you get on this train after standin' in the rain
You'd be crazy to exit
And give your seat to the next one, nah
I'ma ride this shit 'til the wheels fall off
The conductor screams out, "All aboard, last call"
The city as you pass on, the city as you pass on

[Hook: Carla Morrison]
Otra ciudad, otra vida, otra, otra ciudad, ah, oh, oh, oh
<END TEXT>
[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now its gone
Lets leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Same city, yeah, we cant break up
Nice mask on, I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment  whats the matter?
Shes learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I dont blame her, my mind is gone
Im at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I dont hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Dont wanna break you, but Im leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now its gone

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now its gone
Lets leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
Its over, over

[Bridge: Buffalo Madonna]
Didnt believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now Im on the homies couch
Always going out, sleeping round with strangers
Danger! But you cant live without her
Now youre paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she aint like you alone
Havent made love with the lights still on
Its like youre hiding something from me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Lets fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin, staring into those two eyes
And I cant take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, lets keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love  maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to God, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately, Ive been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that Im leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and its so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

[Bridge: Macklemore & Buffalo Madonna]
Cant get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Cant get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
Love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over

I couldn't escape
I'd been escaping the whole time
I had to finally look
Look at the mess we had made
And all that's lacker the glory
And tarnished failures
Stare at it... and then leave

I was too comfortable
Being comfortable is what kills artists
There is creativity for validation and there is creativity for survival
They're very different places
I didn't know what I wanted to say
Didn't know how the ink would stick to the page
How to let go of the anxiety
And the suffocating fear that latched onto my vocal chords
I had to figure out how to use my voice again

So we went ghost
The Irish goodbye, into the woods in the dead of winter
We bought a 1985 Suburban, loaded up our equipment
And just left town

People make music for all different reasons
It's the fabric that connects us
We dance together, we cry together
We celebrate our communities
We question our politics
We laugh, we scream, we imagine, we live
What I couldn't find in a hotel room on the road, or even in Seattle
I found in the middle of nowhere, no reception
Making music not because we had to, but because we got to
I had forgotten how to do that
Not being afraid of the platform we were standing on
Not creating from a place of "Don't fuck it up"
But creating from a place of "Fuck it up"

Look at the mess
Not just the one that we created
But the one that is the very fabric of our country
The mess we're all living in
Stop being silent
Even if it's not perfect or politically correct, you have to speak up
You have to listen
Dance, cry, question everything
Laugh, scream, imagine, live

Music was never intended to be programmed to, manufactured and turned into a commodity
Music was intended to be that one thing that we could rely on to disrupt the norm
Start conversations and change the way that we think and we feel

If you aren't scared of what you created, you aren't done yet
On February 26th, I want to share with you
This Unruly Mess I've Made
<END TEXT>
[Intro]
"Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?"
What what, what, what [x8]
Bada, bada, bada dada

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now, walk into the club, like, "What up, I got a big cock!"
Nah, Im just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, Damn, thats a cold ass honkey!
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink; except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
(Pissssss...) But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it
Bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins
Someone else has been walking in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stunting and flossing and saving my money
And Im hella happy; thats a bargain, bitch!
Ima take your grandpa's style, Ima take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne aint got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, Ah, he got the Velcros.

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
Im digging, Im digging
Im searching right through that luggage
One mans trash, thats another mans come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-
Up shirt, cause right now, Im up in here stuntin'
Im at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
Im not, Im not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
Ill take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and Ill rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, Oh, that Gucci? Thats hella tight
Im like, Yo, thats 50 dollars for a t-shirt.
Limited edition, lets do some simple addition
50 dollars for a t-shirt, thats just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirts hella dough, and having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella dont
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryin' to get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella wont! Man, you hella won't!

[Interlude]
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Bridge: Wanz]
I wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
Im in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Outro]
"Is that your grandma's coat?"

[Intro: Macklemore]
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And I was like "Fuck that", humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty, just hopin' that I could find a bum
To buy a 40 for me and have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sippin' on some lean I would let loose
Lookin' in the mirror, watchin' myself lose
Cleaned up in oh-eight, got a job makin' barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with R.L., performing in front of eight people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
Now watching my pops in the back row grinnin'
With his glass up to my mom, toastin' his Guinness

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And we on, we on
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
One day we'll leave here
But these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yeah, nah, I won't win it yet, I probably won't get it, but
I'ma give it everything, play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all, everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control, and my soul's mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city, Seattle, that raised me
Rule four-thousand-and-eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Outro: Macklemore]
Oh my God
Feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit

[Interlude: Macklemore]
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"

[Outro: Macklemore]
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis
Put 'em up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up (so high)
<END TEXT>
Yesterday, forget it
Tomorrow is nada
The present is right here, through the breath, watch it
Atheist Jesus piece, hanging on a cross
We sit and discuss God on lawn chairs
About how we got here
What it is, what it isn't, shit
Fate vs. fate, scrimmaging with coincidence
Leave out the market and hold up on the business end
Focus on the genuine, and everything else, you can shed the skin
I was a couple moves away from being dead
In that ER overdosing, eyes bleeding red
I fell in love, made an album, got a buzz
Lost it all, sobered up and guess what?
Now we meet again
And now I'm back, finally just laughin'
Expectations are resentments waiting to happen
Studying the Dharma, Karma, Vipassana practice
Bah'u'llh, Buddah, God to the mountaintop and I'm traveling
Learning, yes, reflecting on what matters
People, impermanence, lack of attachments
It's space and time, a couple man-made distractions
The measure of a spirit that no human can ever capture
Church, ha, this booth is my Vatican
I don't control life, but I control how I react to it
Student of the breath, break beats and balancing
Desire vs. truth until I finally find happiness

I was put here to do something before I'm lying in that casket
I'd be lying on the beat if I said I didn't know what that is
The world's a stage and we play a character, I found him
It took me 20 something years and a bunch of shitty soundchecks
I'm not gonna be content, till I find gratitude
Regardless of my sales or the record deals that they're handing you
If the next generation takes a legacy in samples
You will have a bunch of mp3's of misled kids to pass 'em to
I use my veins to create the color I paint from
Delve into self until my heart becomes my paint brush
I told my momma I'm not stopping till my names up
Thinkin' those comments on that blog is gonna save us
Searching for everything but God to validate ya
Get insecure and then we start blaming the haters
Used to look to women to fill a part of me that was vacant
Truth, the only thing that I ever used in moderation
So I stare into this paper instead of sitting at a cubicle
Take all the ugly shit inside and try to make it beautiful
Use the cement from rock bottom and make it musical
So that people can relate to where I've been
Where I'm going, what I've seen, what I've heard
From the guts, fuck the glory
Just a person on a porch putting it all into recording
Many in my past and many that came before me
I just keep walking my path and I'm blessed to share my story
<END TEXT>
[Intro on Ryan Lewis Remix]
"Vipassana is a science of mind and matter: how the mind is influencing the body and later how the body is influencing the mind."

[Verse 1]
Yesterday?
Forget it
Tomorrow is?
Nada
The present is right here, through the breath, watch it
Atheist Jesus piece, hangin' on a cross
We sit and discuss God on lawn chairs
About how we got here

Church, this booth is my Vatican
I don't control life, but I can control how I react to it
Student of the breath, brick beats and balancin'
Desire versus truth until I finally find happiness

[Hook]
Passing through space and time
Passing through space and time, oh
Passing through space and time
Space and time
Space and time

[Verse 2]
I was put here to do something before I'm lying in that casket
I'd be lying on the beat if I said I didn't know what that is

[Verse 1]
Pulled into the parking lot, parked it
Zipped up my parka, joined the procession of marchers
In my head like, "Is this awkward?
Should I even be here marching?"
Thinking if they can't, how can I breathe?
Thinking that they chant, what do I sing?
I want to take a stance cause we are not free
And then I thought about it, we are not "we"
Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out?
Is it my place to give my two cents?
Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth?
"No justice, no peace," okay, I'm saying that
They're chanting out, "Black Lives Matter," but I don't say it back
Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand
In front of a line of police that look the same as me
Only separated by a badge, a baton, a can of Mace, a mask
A shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi
In case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the 9
Takes another child's life on sight

[Hook]
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
Blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free
There's blood in the streets, no justice, no peace
No racist beliefs, no rest 'til we're free

[Interlude 1]

[Macklemore, speaking over voices]
"Oh, what are you doing Ben? What are you doing here?"

[Various indistinct male voices]
"Probably shouldn't be here, you have white supremacy, don't fuckin' come here.  Culture Vulture!  ('Black Lives Matter,' say it.)  Wow.  ('Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter.')  You should not have done that. Why the fuck would you do that?  (What are you doing here?)  You always react. Just let it go, man.  White racist.  It's the Grammys!"

[Macklemore]
"Ben, think about it."

[Verse 2]
You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment
The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with
The culture was never yours to make better
You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea
Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic
You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in
Your brand of hip-hop, it's so fascist and backwards
That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard
All the money that you made
All the watered down pop-bullshit version of the culture, pal
Go buy a big-ass lawn, go with your big-ass house
Get a big-ass fence, keep people out
It's all stolen, anyway, can't you see that now?
There's no way for you to even that out
You can join the march, protest, scream and shout
Get on Twitter, hashtag and seem like you're down
But they see through it all, people believe you now?
You said publicly, "Rest in peace, Mike Brown"
You speak about equality, but do you really mean it?
Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?
Want people to like you, want to be accepted
That's probably why you are out here protesting
Don't think for a second you don't have incentive
Is this about you, well, then what's your intention?
What's the intention? What's the intention?

[Interlude 2: Protesters]
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"
"Hands up? Don't shoot!"

[Verse 3]
"Pssst, I totally get it, you're by yourself
And the last thing you want to do is take a picture
But seriously, my little girl loves you
She's always singing, 'I'm gonna pop some tags'
I'm not kidding, my oldest, you even got him to go thrifting
And 'One Love,' oh my God, that song, brilliant
Their aunt is gay, when that song came out
My son told his whole class he was actually proud
That's so cool, look what you're accomplishing
Even the old mom like me likes it, cause it's positive
You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to
Cause you get it, all that negative stuff it isn't cool"
Yeah?
"Yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs
The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs
Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb
If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run"
Huh?

[Interlude 3: Various male and female voices]
"So, they feel that the police are discriminating against the... the black people?  I have an advantage? Why? Cause I'm white? (laughs) What? (laughs) No.  See, more people nowadays are just pussies. Like, this is the generation to be offended by everything.  'Black Lives Matter' thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights.  I'm not prejudiced, I just...  99% of the time, across this country, the police are doing their job properly."

[Verse 4]
Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment
Some of us scared, some of us defensive
And most of us aren't even paying attention
It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist
Than we actually are with racism
I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive
What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue
Actually looked at myself, actually got involved?
If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know
Hip-hop has always been political, yes
It's the reason why this music connects
So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying
Then I'm trying to be politically correct?
I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets
Rap entrepreneur, built his own business
If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with
Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick
The DIY underdog, so independent
But the one thing the American dream fails to mention
Is I was many steps ahead to begin with
My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image
America feels safe with my music in their systems
And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it
And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain
White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho
White supremacy protects the privilege I hold
White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home
White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent
My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson  guilty
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?
We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by
We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?

[Interlude 4: Various male and female voices]
"Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most.  My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere.  The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members.  I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'"

[Outro: Jamila Woods]
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free
What I got for me, it is for me
What we made, we made to set us free

[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
Thats what it is (thats what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)
Cant see me through my tints (nah ah)
Im riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I aint got 24s (nuh-uh)
But Im on those Vogues
Thats those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
Im rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn yall mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Hook: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
Im rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Man Im lounging in some shit Bernie Mac wouldve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn thats stylish
Smilin, dont pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, Im smashing
Im ducking, bucking them out here
Im looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what its like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew Id have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, Im from Seattle, theres hella Honda Civics
I couldnt tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, there's a problem with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Hook: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
Im rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like shes writing rhymes
I had her inhaling my love, tryna blow my mind
Cadillac pimpin, my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving and smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all, kill the fucking whips
See what's popping at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my balls
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
Im motherfuckin awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so youll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old
When I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, "Momma
This air bubble right here
Its gonna make me fly"
I hit that court
And when I jumped, I jumped
I swear I got so high
I touched the net, "Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life"
Air Maxes were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the tread
In school
I was so cool
I knew that I couldnt crease em
My friends couldnt afford em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasnt the best
But my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos brother got murdered for his fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didnt wanna get caught
From Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground
Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy
I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool
And I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Group of children]
I want to fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And Ill go so high
Ill go so high
My feet wont touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
We want what we cant have
Commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn
I just got to flaunt it
Got to show em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes
I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me
Im a cool kid
Im an individual, yeah
But Im part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
"Are you stupid?
Dont crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!"
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
Thats my air bubble and Im lost, if it pops
We are what we wear
We wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change
Or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me
But Im trying to take mine
Off

[Hook: Group of children]
I want to fly
Can you take me far away
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And Ill go so high
Ill go so high
My feet wont touch the ground
Just stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

[Verse 3]
They started out
With what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see its just another pair of shoes
