[Intro]
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Verse 2]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Outro]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

[Verse 1]
Carry me up them stairs
Put my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
"What is all this?", you said
"The mess upstairs
Don't be scared"

Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stop at the K-Mart
Buy me my peach lip gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
Mad magazines, and white socks
All in your car for
Our trip across the U.S.A

[Chorus]
We going to party
Like it's 1949
We in the Pontiac
From July to July

It's a flower motel nation
Day and night on our last vacation
We going to see it all
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Daddy likes Blackpool
Pleasure Beach and road stops
Baby likes some Swiss Apps
Souvenir gift shops

Late night, midnight
Radio show talks
Daddy, baby
Big jail break

[Verse 3]
Ponytail and lollipops
Dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit
Ruched tops and Cadillacs

Blue lake car to Dunks
Hopscotch, shit talk
Alabama hard knocks
Motel dress locks

[Chorus]
We going to party
Like it's 1949
We in the Pontiac
From July to July

It's a flower motel nation
Day and night on our last vacation
We going to see it all
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 1]
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

[Chorus]
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you love

[Verse 2]
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

[Chorus]
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you love

[Outro]
Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch
<END TEXT>
You know it & I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh the wind is carrying me home
Me home me home again

Well you know it & I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far
You saw life back in the countryside
Ahhh ahh ahh

Oh my soul rise up & go beyond, beyond
To what you know

I'm America's sweetheart, try'na get away
You make it hard to leave, but it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here with the fighting, baby
We're not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray, but, boy, I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear, so

I'm goin' back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A
Never comin' back, boy
No matter what you do, I'll say, "'Cause I'm so afraid"

And I've had it up to here with the panic and the fear
There's nothin' in your heart, thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Drivin' in your fast car, lookin' at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between a woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way to come back from where you came

So I'm goin' back to, Santa Monica, New York to L.A
Never comin' back, boy
No matter what you do, I'll say, "'Cause I'm so afraid."

Oh, I've had it up to here with the panic and the fear
Nothin' in your heart, boy, I thought that I could make you change
I am so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years
But I'm leavin' now

I'm goin' back to Santa Monica, New York to L.A
Never comin' back, boy, no matter what you do or say
I am done bein' afraid

Whoa, I've had it up to here with the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart, I thought that I could make you change
I am so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I am done being afraid

Oh, oh, oh

Never coming back, boy

All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
May

I'm all smiles but inside I frown
Cause I've seen you walkin around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face

I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers

You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done

I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun
More fun
<END TEXT>
You have a right to live your life
Like no one else does, like no one else might
If you have visions, come on and live them out

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go until you are home, dear

I had a dream when I was young
I dreamt our lives were going to be fun
We were always waiting to live

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go of it all, dear

You have a choice to hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it, I heard it in my sleep

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go, don't say no, dear

Wake up each night at the same time
Roll up the blind and look outside
And in the orange light, the fog is rising

This is life, this tonight, peace in the quiet
Happiness is the sky

Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions
They will never understand

Bow your heads and take your hands

They were angels forever
Forever angels

Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?

Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
Cause you want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
Cause you want more

[Verse 2]
Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that've yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
Cause you want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
You want more (why?)
Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
So we stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
Cause you want more (why?)

You want more (why?)

Trailer park love, wearing them ASICS and gold
I can speak Spanish
You can sing for the neighbors
You've been pretty stupid ever since you got famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side of the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only we'd go back, boy

Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

[Chorus]
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see

[Verse 2]
Baby we could go back to the basics (c'mon)
We were best friends, crazy and shameless in love
You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I ever had boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you remember that, boy?

Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out too
Us against the world just
Me and you (ooh-ooh)!

[Verse 3]
We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink cadillac

Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G

Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, if it's less like I am dreaming

Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey]
We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
Blue is the colour of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lana Del Rey, both]
But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(Let's not waste it, love)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Stevie Nicks, both]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, both]
Yeah we've gotta try (lie-la-lie)
We gotta walk through fire (lie-la-lie)
Because we're just

[Intro]
Uh, what? Starz, starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

[Verse 1]
You're so easy to love
You make me coo coo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry

[Chorus]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

[Verse 2]
Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach ride, time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not going back
I loved him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you

[Chorus]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

[Bridge]
L is for the love you that gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is X that we took with champagne

[Rap: Starz]
I dont wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
Im not selfish, I cant help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

[Verse 3]
Hit me and it felt like kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

[Chorus]
(Sing it to me baby)
Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player baby

[Verse 1 - Spoken]
On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can all get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

[Verse 2]
I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in LA
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll and blaring, I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only dream
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

(You know what I'm talking about)

[Verse 3]
It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

But when I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet

I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

[Chorus]

Yeah, it's all because of you
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I like em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
And if you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me holy in the sky like a pizza pie
(Are you crazy?)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I like em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy
You know I like em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

[Chorus]
Everybodys saying youre no good for me
But they dont see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But Im not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybodys saying youre no good for me
But they dont see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

[Verse 2]
I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I dont need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes Im his cherry pie

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I like em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy
You know I like em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah

Everybodys saying youre no good for me
But they dont see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

[Bridge]
Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
(Behind closed doors)

[Chorus]
Everybodys saying youre no good for me
But they dont see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But Im not gonna do it, baby (no way)

Only shout a little but you give me more

Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait, but I cant wait to see you
So I run like Im mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

[Chorus]
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

You drive up in a summer sky, blue bentley
Death reflect detecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue bentley
Sun reflect detecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, We drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue bentley

Death reflect detecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

[Verse 1]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the 'Houses of the Holy'
Smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby thats a shame
You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

[Chorus 1]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now
It's over

[Verse 2]
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit; nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

[Pre-Chorus]
But you were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby thats a shame
You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus 2]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now
That it's over
Baby, how you feeling now
That I told you

[Bridge]
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls
Love the way Bill plays guitar

[Chorus]
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Honey, how you feeling now
That it's over
Baby, how's life treating you now
That I told you

I told you not to go into the woods

You took all the apples that I had
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know youll rock my world

Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark
Lifting up my little red skirt
I know youll leave me here in the dirt
But I heart you, and I wanna be YOUR girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world!

[Hook]

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothings wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, youre tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then youll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car

I saw you creeping around the garden, what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullaby

With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

[Pre-Chorus 2]
As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

[Chorus]
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

So it'd suit the mood with your soul
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue

Life is beautiful, but you dont have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, ooh

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light, love is lost on you

To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you cant let everything seem so dark blue
But oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you?

Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and..

Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say

First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day

Never knew how much I missed until then

My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my cunt too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo

Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
(Say you remember!)
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters
Gangsters not bred I make them
Gangsters not dead I raise 'em

And I know that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, no please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing paper
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night and baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out the door a piece of me died
I told you I "wanted more"
That's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

(She said dont worry 'bout it)

[Chorus]
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire
Baby I'm on fire

[Bridge]
My clothes still smell like you
All the photographs say you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt and go about the world like I'm having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary's swaying softly to her hearts delight

[Chorus]
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
Sing the body electric
I'm on fire
Baby I'm on fire

[Verse 1]
Everytime you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

Everytime you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been witholding
I'm not like every other girl

[Hook]
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho, Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for

[Verse 2]
So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"

I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

[Hook]

[Outro x2]
I need your love babe
I need your loving

[Outro 2 : Indian-like instrumental]
<END TEXT>
I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do

Femme fatale always on the run
Diamonds on my neck, whiskey on my tongue
Before I get back I gotta get drunk
So get over here pour me a cold one
Babe he can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage yeah
Sparkling in sequins say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

Wrong, I know, killing someone
Gets a little easier after done it once
You know that I'm fine, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine, let's get it on

Babe he can see that I'm danger
Glamorous but I'm deranged, yeah
Dancing on top of the tables
I said it really nice, hey, can you be my saviour?

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

I love you, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling

Dancing on top of the tables
Stronger, I wish I was able
Some [?] but I'm not capable
I gotta get you back, cause I gotta live [?]

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck

[Intro]
Why? (hey, man!)
Who, me? (alright!)
Why? (hey, man!)

[Verse 1]
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh  Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

[Verse 2]
Lost, but now I am found
I can see, but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh  Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die

[Bridge]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

[Pre-Chorus]
So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh  Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus]
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So, choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
(We were born to die)

[Verse 1]
The greatest line in history
Baby its not you, its me
What you think Im dumb, dumb babydoll
Im big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

Oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh
If you really care

[Chorus]
Dont go and blow it all, its bad enough baby
I dont wanna hear you saying its not you, its me
If theres blood on my hands, you should let me know
If youre done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
Theres nothing you can say to break my fall

[Verse 2]
Greatest lie in history: baby its not you, its me
Do you really think Ill buy your bullshit boy?
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You havent gone and hurt me yet
But you know that Ill crumble if you call

Oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh
If you really care

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]
Im not gonna let you become a martyr
Im not gonna let you pickup the gun
Im gonna make this a whole lot harder
Wont make it easy for you to run

I know we fight, we go out every night
But what do you expect from a Hollywood lifestyle?
He says it's wrong, no baby boy, it's right
Passion is a thing you can't buy, its hard to find

[Chorus]
You're breaking my heart tonight
Kissing me hard, see Valentina stars delight
I just wanna party tonight
We're breaking all the rules
But baby, it all feels so right
You're breaking my heart tonight
Take me for a ride boy
Don't leave me on the side boy

You're breaking my heart tonight
Kissing me hard, see Valentina stars delight

But baby, it all feels so right

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I say
I say

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
But I'm free
I'm free

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey]
Im talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

[Chorus - Variation: Lana Del Rey]
And my boyfriends in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collections rare
I get down to beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Yeah my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Verse 1]
Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been, I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here (come on, tell me boy)

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire, come on, tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire, come on, tell me boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Verse 2]
Every Saturday night, I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer (come on, tell me boy)

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire, come on, tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire, come on, tell me boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Bridge] (x4)
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire, come on, tell me boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire, come on, tell me boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits cause I just don't care
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)
<END TEXT>
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden

[Verse 1]
You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him "go on, sing a sad song."

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and cuts their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

[Chorus]
Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

[Verse 2]
You're hard to trap, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far-gone

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
These butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
I puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho...)

[Verse 1]
Were sippin' cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems youre all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, Ive been through this before
They say Ill save you, save you, but they never do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that Ill leave you
Its sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I cant be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies
I made the decision that Im too good for you
Then I see you're calling, its hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies

[Verse 2]
Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
I wanna take you, take you to the world outside.
Well, I assume its what I wanted at the time
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign
I wanna take you, take you, and I didnt mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And even though I didnt believe you
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always needs you
Try to reach you, try to please you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I cant be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies
I made the decision that Im too good for you
Then I see you're calling, its hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I cant let go, Im sure that we should be forever

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I look around, theres no one above you
I think you know that Ill always love you
And baby, Im bad too, its not just you
But I cant wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything youve done makes me wanna run, run, run

[Chorus]
I made the decision that I cant be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies
I made the decision that Im too good for you
Then I see you're calling, its hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies

I made the decision that I cant be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies
I made the decision that Im too good for you
Then I see you're calling, its hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-Im getting butterflies, I-Im getting butterflies

Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe"

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

[Verse 1]
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen"
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age"
Lying, I'm lying

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
White lightning

[Verse 2]
Carmen, Carmen
Staying up till morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She says, "you don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free"
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day"
It's tiring, tiring

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
White lightning

[Bridge]
Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

[Interlude]
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

[Chorus]
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah

Like lightning, woah
White lightning

So I heard you wanna go to Rio baby
Yes, I've seen page six lately, ahh
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit

Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She's got the best, sparklin' like a hollywood movie, ahhh

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release and you're so cold
Are you crazy?

You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

Cause we were a match in heaven high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string x4

[Verse 1]
Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
My my, apple in my eye
Looking really hot while I'm making cherry pie
Show me what you got, got the sparkle in your eye
You're so high

[Chorus]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

[Verse 2]
Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

[Chorus]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

[Bridge]
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, look at daddy shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
While I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

[Chorus]
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

[Vere 3]
Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

[Pre-Chorus 3]
My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing up nice
Drinks on ice

[Chorus]
I'm yours  and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

[Outro]
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you

[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's comin' in strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

[Refrain]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful bein's
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time Summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughin', but now it's in my blood

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

[Refrain]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful bein's
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time Summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when

Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flash
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind
We are ugly but we have the music."

Ah, but, you got away, yeah, didn't you baby
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often
<END TEXT>
[Snippet]
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave and you're very free

So swing it high, cherry blossom
On your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

Swing it high like Jesus, baby
Little ghost so fair like lemonade tea

[Verse 1]
Love, I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

[Verse 2]
Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)

[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?)

[Outro]
'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (bitch), are ruined (fuck!)

[Intro]
Take me in your fast car Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you're driving
He- he doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buying into every line

[Verse 1]
I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

[Hook]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's their only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free

[Verse 2]
Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so arty
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

[Hook]
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's their only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free free free free free free free
Get free

[Verse 3]
Run for our lives
They got all our chains
Let's hope that we merge
Create our own games
DJ's, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
They're celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

[Hook 2x]

We're gonna get free

[Verse 1]
I was at Coachella, leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it, 'cause baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause what about all these children
Ad what about all their parents?
And what about about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question

[Verse 2]
I was at Coachella, leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What about all these children and all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question

[Outro]
A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway

I hope you remember me like this
Dancing in the stars in my sundress
I was just a dreamer, no stress
And battles lines became paradise next to you

You been working hard 9 to 5 and
I'm doing my part in trying
Just to make you smile and get happy
Like daddy used to say to me
"When you're young and free
Stop and think of me"
Staying together is heaven when you look so good
And you taste so sweet

Never let me go
Boy hang on to me
Staying together forever it's heaven when you taste so sweet

When you're young and free

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and hes making me crazy

All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Drugs suck it up like vanilla icys
Dont treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck
Diamantes ices

I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on baby, lets ride

We made it out to the other side

And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
(Dead, like you)
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you except in my dreams tonight

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper, i l-l-love you

Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here
Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine
<END TEXT>
You didnt think about anyone else
You didnt think about any of us when you left that place
You didnt wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But youre wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, youre annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
Theyre trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
Youre such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
Its just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think well be in love forever?
Do you think well be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now, low down and gritty?
Do you think well be in love forever?
Do you think well be in love?

[Verse 1]
Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
Im not gonna listen to what the past says
Ive been waiting up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says hes gonna teach me just what fast is
Say its gonna be alright

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think well be in love forever?

Lets take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what were here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty

Move down, up slow
Prostitute stare
I do what I like
I just don't care

I am my only god

Black eyes
Short dress

Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know, no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

[Bridge]
Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

[Chorus]
Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1]
They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

[Verse 2]
They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

[Pre-Chorus 1: Demo Version]
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends, but Im the one that they want
Miss America, with the blue mascara on

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

[Verse 3]
Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

[Pre-Chorus 2: Demo Version]
I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now Im gone, baby, gone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

[Chorus - Shortened]
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

I'm a wild child, bright child, knocking at your door
You thought that you were done but now you want me even more
Dum dum
You want me even more

I'm a star child, big smile, living in L.A
I'm coming over, baby, you can't go to school today
Dum dum
Go to school today
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara of the downtown scene
Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink
I'm a pop-blues singer, fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer from the Hollywood silver screen, silver screen

[Chorus]
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of heaven my way
You'll be forever changed

I'm a wild child, sky high, lying on your floor
I know I had a lot, but baby, what's a little more?
Dum dum
Want a little more
Dum dum

In my white mink, pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies from Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone of the deep Sahara
Cause I'm on the scene, yeah, I'm on the scene
I'm a bad jazz singer, giving you the finger
No matter what, you'll linger
Cause you like me even when I'm mean, I'm the queen

French vanilla ice cream
Just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen
I cant get a bite

Guess we could be more than friends
Cause this kiss wont end
And you got me tremblin

[Chorus]
Youre dynamite
Im ready to blow
Take me out tonight
Youre dynamite
Im ready to go
Touch me to ignite

Boy, youre a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, youre dynamite

[Verse 2]
Speeding through the wasteland
Sparkling in the lights
Roll up to the boardwalk
Derelict delight

Eyes all on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, youre all adrenaline

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hes not like other guys
I cant apologize
For what my body wants
And what my heart decides

Cause Im so close to the real thing
Yeah, Im so close to the real thing
Im so close to the real thing
I could almost die

Say it isnt over
Say its not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere
Start a pillow fight

[Verse 1]
Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar

Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

[Verse 2]
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far

You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

[Chorus]
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?
<END TEXT>
Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore ?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does...

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye...

[Intro]
You can whistle for it

[Verse 1]
Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as we got Chevrolet, I will ride

[Pre-hook]
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

[Verse 2]
You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

[Pre-hook]
We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

[Chorus]

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

[Bridge]
I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
(Special side of heartbreak)
I was working down at the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
(How you get that way?)
I said
He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses

[Verse 1]
You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)

You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

[Hook]
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

[Verse 2]
You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby you're on the run
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)

You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissing me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused

Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there aint nothing I can do?

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day my husband to be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree but the unlucky one

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going down, now
With all of my

[Chorus]
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough but it wasn't
The earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire but we were wooden

[Verse 2]
I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day my mother to be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

I'm going down, now
With all of my

Or are you gonna hurt me later?

You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somethin' you're tellin' me- what? I don't know

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but

Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

Drinks on the patio
Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy

Dressed up just to hear you, boy

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know

I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh ya

Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

Sun in my mouth and gold hoops

White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in

It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?

Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me, it's just a stupid bar and
I didn't promise anything, no

You think I'm pretty and you like way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?

[Chorus]
Pretty baby
Pretty baby
Ahh

[Verse 2]
The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now

Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no

[Chorus]
Pretty baby
Pretty baby
Ahh
Pretty baby

All these feelings I'm tired of them,
Ruling over my life again.
Emotions aren't my friend,
I keep them ordered as best I can.

I can, you can, we can do,
Can keep it all together.
Layman, workman, his man, her man,
How about about the weather?

All these people I'm tired of them,
Sifting into my life again.
Their questions, the "how and when",
I try and answer the best that I can but.

I can, you can, we can do,
Can keep it all together.
Layman, workman, his man, her man,
How about about the weather?

All my worries, they come and go,
They tend to leave when I let you know.
On bad days I take it slow,
I try to dance when I hit a low.

I can, you can, we can do,
Can keep it all together.
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man,
It will all get better.

Oh, the days they go so fast,
I can't believe what is in my past.
The future's here at last,
I don't need to have what she has.

I can, you can, we can do,
Can keep it all together.
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man,
It will all get better.

Sing it out, sing it loud,
Sing it out, sing it loud.
Be proud, come out,
Be proud, come out.

I can, you can, we can do,
Can keep it all together.
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man,
We can make it better, yeah,
We will have it better.

[Verse 1]
30 blocks to Fordham Road
Thats a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldnt do what it is I could

[Verse 2]
The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

[Chorus]
I dont know why it is that I wanna stay
I dont know what it is that makes me feel this way
But Im not gonna do what I hear me say
Im just gonna walk
Im gonna walk away

[Verse 3]
I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee
Theres a place on Valentine that still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime, and in my eyes its always night time
And I like it when its me at night
Cause thats when all the stars come out

[Chorus]
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I;m not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk
I'm gonna walk away

[Bridge]
It's the greatest
It's the greatest day
It's the greatest
It's the greatest day

I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk
I'm gonna walk away

[Verse 1]
Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 2]
Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Bridge]
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 1]
Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For... and for... (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)

[Verse 2]
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of bein'
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no more chasin' rainbows
And hopin' for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothin' to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)
Out of the black (out of the black)

You got a face like the Madonna, crying tears of gold
Been pumping gas at the Texaco, road to road
You're on the run, oh, baby, yeah
You're on the run, oh, baby
I'm not a trick, but I'm a trick for you
You give me butterflies; heart's skipping one, two
I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures thinking of your love, boo

[Chorus]
Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby

Come on over, ghetto baby

I know your lips say that you wanna, but your heart's a no
But boy, your hips say that you're gonna when you hold me, hold me
You're so fun, b-baby, you are too much fun, b-baby

You're out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

We're a match made in Heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

But when he's good, no one's better
Cause we're a match made in Heaven
And this kind of love's forever

Sometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

[Chorus]
God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
To red, blue and yellow lights
On Monday they destroyed me
But by Friday I'm revived
Put on that hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

[Chorus]
God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God know's I lived
Begged, borrowed and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

Light up my life

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel, living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

[Refrain 1]
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we dont get along, so now I sing

[Chorus]
No ones gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and Im singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Verse 2]
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel, looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

[Refrain 2]
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby that's alright with me."

[Chorus]
No ones gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and Im singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

[Bridge]
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me, "Life isn't that hard."

[Chorus]
No ones gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and Im singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

What happened to 'nobody does it better'?
See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're pickin up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way

The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied

There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way

You act like youre gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done

Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Are you at the archive, watching television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?
And your leather lookin' like Greg Kinnear?
Are you still the king of rock'n'roll, babe?
Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that west side highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?
Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe wedding ring and the tire light
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You're in the bar, playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with the star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, livin' it up
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Time after time, writin' my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Takin' our dreams, turnin' them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Lana Del Rey]
Front row, every show like a hype man (hmm)
Sing along word for word while she my bae (yeah)
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade (hmm, hmm)
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate (hmm, hmm)
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love (hmm)
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a... (hmm)
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die (You and I 'til the day we die)

[Verse 1]
Heavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway
Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

[Chorus]
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

[Verse 2]
Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway
We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
Took your bike to Detroit
Back to the promised land

[Chorus]
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

[Bridge]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turning tan and you look terrific
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game

[Chorus] (x2)
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Mr President

The way you deal with U.S. Steel
And our problems by the ton
We thank you so much

Everybody, happy birthday

[Verse 1]
Hawaiian tropic, dark and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

[Chorus]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

[Verse 2]
Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

[Verse 3]
Copacabana, yes in my party dress
Im shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

[Chorus - Variation 2]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying?

[Bridge]
And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

[Chorus - Variation]
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

[Verse 4]
I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

[Outro]
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late

You're bigger than Elvis and cooler than B.I.G
You're smashing the dishes, you're Billy The Kid
You're very American, sugar, marry me, Dick
I love you

We're on the road to the Jersey Shore
One stoppin' at the Staten Island Mall
Pulling over at the 7/11, and you buy me pie because I'm sweeter than heaven

You say you love everything I am
Love my lips and my golden tan
You love my heartshaped sunglasses
Love my heartshaped sunglasses
Love my heartshaped sunglasses
Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, heaven like you're crazy
You let me drive I'll let you go all the way
I'll never ever, ever, ever let you get away, away

[Verse 1]
I was lounging in the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool."

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I heard a man screaming, "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
Open up that Lamborghini

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy hitter
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's c-c-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

[Verse 2]
You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixing our souls to escape reality

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughing, I was running
Use that remote to open up

[Chorus]
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's c-c-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You can be my higher power, baby
I can be your endless USA
We can go on drives for hours, baby
Let's cha-a-ange our DNA
Let's change our DNA
Let's change

Open up your butterfly doors

[Verse 1]
Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Life rocked me like Mtley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

[Chorus 1]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Verse 2]
Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clear

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Life rocked me like Mtley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

[Chorus 2]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Bridge]
(It's fucking hot, hot) Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot) Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumpin' off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby (baby) come on (come on) come on (come on)

[Chorus 3]
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby

[Outro]
(It's hot, hot) Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

[Verse 1]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Verse 2]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Bridge]
Lights, camera, accin
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, accin
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye

Sitting in your lap for my interview

Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run

Pick me up in your white Lamborghini
London town, you'll watch out while I'm singing
Glamorous on the stage, boy, believe me
Keep your girl back, no competing

Eyeing you from across the room
Watching me, wa-watching you

Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run

You know this world's mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly

[Verse 1]
One day my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
Ill spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood
Sun will rise, Im a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
Im alive again
Im alive again

[Verse 2]
One day Ill drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shootin heroin and speedballs
See the sea, Im a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

[Chorus]
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
Im alive again
Im alive again

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, c-can you see me?
Woah-oah, my heart beating fast
I can feel it chasing in the speedlights
I was built to last
Woah-oah, c-can you feel that?
Ah, ah, my heart's shakin fast
I can feel that youre the one for me
You'll be my first and you'll be my last

[Verse 1]
Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time

And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover
For all of the trouble
You got into

[Pre -Chorus 1]
I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

[Chorus 1]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Roland is dying
And in the light you're
Sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye you're
Sickeningly beautiful

[Verse 2]
This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girls
Try as I might
In the end
It's a cruel world

And you
Are living proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor
Who only went after
The ones who swooned

[Pre - Chorus 2]
I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like the limelight

[Chorus 2]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying
In the light you're
Sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye you're
Sickeningly beautiful

[Bridge]
If you should go before me then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

[Chorus 3]
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon wake up
Cobain stop lying
In the light you're
Sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye you're
Sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight you're
So beautiful

[Outro]
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Yeah

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

[Verse 1]
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dying for him to come over
Im in my party dress, he say, "You such a mess."
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen, he is the construction king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best cause he knows whats up
He knows its a big bad world, knows that Im a good girl
He understands the sale of self
(Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

J. is a romantic roller coaster
He dont do anything he supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean, Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be looking to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high
He knows its a big bad world, knows that Im a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Cause cash comes quick when looks can (kill)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue
I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Verse 1]
I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in Mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Verse 2]
Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

[Bridge]
Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

[Chorus]
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

He don't like no small things
Even riding round on tall dreams
I don't want to go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

[Pre-Chorus]
He got a way, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

[Chorus]
I don't want to go, go home
I don't want to go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Loving you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Loving you isn't right
It's original sin

[Chorus]

I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything that I like
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything, tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Interlude]
Money is the reason we exist
Eveybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

[Interlude 2]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]
I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon

[Verse 4]
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

[Chorus]
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem

Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby

I was in a bad way, honey
Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don't wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way

Bring me that bud/Bring it on up/punk, you know that I want you/it
I'm not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
?Everybody used to say??, you're Superman, and I'm not (?)
It's on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don't leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your babydoll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie?
Why do all the best girls like bad guys? Cos they're to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don't wanna go
Take me with you
I don't wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that
<END TEXT>
What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love

Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love

[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin' on my treadmill
But I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time
While you're takin' what's mine with the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

[Chorus]
'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Drown out all our screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

[Verse 2]
I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke they can hear me comin'
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

Got me up in this place right now
Makin' no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feelin' so blue
Makin' no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feelin' so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again

[Verse 1]
Everybody said it wasnt love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long

You told me that we could have it all
Now youre posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said Id never leave you

[Chorus]
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now youre posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

[Verse 2]
Everybody said: Careful of that guy.
Baby couldnt stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feigning love by holding tight
But I need you, dont want to, but need to

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Youve been messing around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I cant trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

[Chorus]
<END TEXT>
Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else

I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else

Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else

[Verse 1]
I guess its symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalking you has sort of become like my occupation
I used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock-star now Im having visions

[Pre - Chorus]
I fell for you, you like me too
Lets get it on, check one two
I fell for you, you want me too
Lets get it on

[Chorus]
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
Im making out with you while youre singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
Youre playing your guitar and its turning me on
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin around like you dont care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If its wrong I dont wanna be right

[Verse 2]
It gets so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, take over domination
Used to be so simple, never wantin and never wishin
Now Im hooked on fame and Im a girl on a mission

[Pre - Chorus - Variation]
I fall for you, its all for you
Lets get it on, check one two
I fall for you, its all for you
Lets get it on

[Chorus]
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
Im making out with you while youre singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
Youre playing your guitar and its turning me on
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin around like you dont care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If its wrong I dont wanna be right

[Bridge]
A funny little thing about love is that youre blind for the time
And even when you think you had enough
Youre wanting more, it isnt right but
You cant stop

[Chorus - Variation]
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin around like you dont care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eye-liner, long hair, walkin around like you dont care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If its wrong I dont wanna be right

[Verse 1]
High up in the Hollywood hills taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
Youre a hard man to love and I'm
A hard woman to keep track of
You like to rage, dont do that
You want your way, you make me so mad
Got your gun, Ive got my dad

[Chorus]
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness

[Verse 2]
High up in the Hollywood hills crushing violet pills
Youve been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the day's long
Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star

[Chorus]
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness

[Bridge]
Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the table
Headshot if you're able

[Chorus]
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness

{Lana del rey}:

And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
he was the only one for me.

We both knew it, right away.

And as the years went on, things got more difficult -
we were faced with more challenges.

I begged him to stay.

Try to remember what we had at the beginning.

He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it.

When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up
to talk to him.

He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.

I always got the sense that he became torn

between being a good person and

missing out on all of the opportunities that life could

offer a man as magnificent as him.

And in that way I understood him

and I loved him.

I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.

And I still love him.

I love him.

You smell like a million roses bathed in rock n roll
Ours was the greatest love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
Thats my baby

He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul

Youve got a way like JFK when you do it

Youre so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy

He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll

Youve got it and I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name
Cause I see a light in your eyes
Its so bright and the skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

[Chorus]
Youve got a way like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby

Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl

Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

All this in the beginning, I really tried

At a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride

I dont quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sun beams mean nothing
If you cant find the light shining in one thing

Its fine if youre hateful
As long as all-in-all you remain grateful
It made me nervous to know you didn't like me
I really tried
The way Im feeling in this moment
It cant last my whole life

My dreams are bigger than your junky pride

Sparkling in sequins, say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

No one lives forever, but thats no reason to give up
Dont you wanna fall in love?

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love suicide?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die

And I'll be murdering and murdering just for fun
Murderin' them, murderin' them one by one
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die

Baby, youre Sylvester Stallone and I can be your Adrian
With Thunderlips, I got you in the ring, just say my name again, say my name again, say my name again

Baby, I cant do it alone, cause youre the one that I want
You can be my Tommy Mottola and I can be Mariah,
Tiger, scream a little higher, I can get you high on love and desire

All since Bonnie and Clyde was two kids
So good at being bad, bad, bad
Im flirting with the check-out counter, baby
Put the money in the bag

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?

It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?

It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die

Would you kill for me? Would you die for me?
Put your hands where I can see them
Put them in the air

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?

[Verse 1]
Would you be mine?
Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know it's you that I adore?
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high
Shining like a God
Can't believe I caught you, and so
Look at what I bought
Not a second thought - oh, Romeo

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

[Bridge]
I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet
I don't care what they say about
What they say about me
Because I know that it's l-o-v-e
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say!)

[Chorus]
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Look at you kids with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love  (ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or go the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

[Bridge]
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy

[Chorus]
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love (ah, ah)
I'm young and in love (ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Outro]
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah, ah, ah)

Don't worry, baby

Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Verse 1]
Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

[Chorus]
Every now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Verse 2]
Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

[Chorus]
Every now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally you and me are the lucky ones this time

[Bridge]
Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

[Chorus]
Every now and then the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally you and me are the lucky ones this time

You know, in this town an artist really needs a lot of space when they're trying to create something special. A place to cultivate a world of their own, far away from the real world that's around them.

Luckily for me, I live right inside the middle of the 'H' of the Hollywood sign, and this is how I spent most of my nights: perched high above the chaos that swirls within the City of Angels below. Now don't get me wrong, I love to dip my toe into the muck and the mires of the city every now and then, especially on Tuesdays. But truthfully, when I'm in the middle of making a record - especially now, when the world is in the middle of such a tumultuous period - I find I really need to take the space for myself, far away from real life to consider what my contribution to the world should be in these dark times.

So each morning I have the luxury of asking myself, "What shall I cook up for the kids today? Something with a little spice? Something with a little bitterness but is ultimately sweet? Or shall I take the day off and turn down the fire, and just take a moment to send my love to them over the ether?" Because sometimes just being pure of heart, and having good intentions, and letting them be known is the most worthy contribution an artist can make.

So, even though these times can feel a little bit crazy, they're not so very different from what other generations have experienced at one time or another before. Amidst all the uncertainty, and as we transition out of one era into another one, there's no place I'd rather be than smack-dab in the middle of 'Hollyweird' making this record for you. Because you and the music, and this place are my love, my light, and my lust for life.

Every time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho, Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho

You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think that my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon Cher, it is."

I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha."

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho, Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho

You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
Where we sing "Maha, oh maha, oh maha, maha."

I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I give my loving, I'm your devoted

Maha, maha, maha, maha, Maha, maha, maha

Hiya honey
What ya doin'?
I been hula-hoopin' waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're tryin' to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Hiya honey
How's it goin'?
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shakin', makin' music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew
She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Singing for the gangsters
Chasin' all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Understand this, Im not looking for true love tonight

Serving coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I dont wanna care tonight, I dont wanna fight
You dont have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

Understand this, I been likin you since I was small

Not quite yet, but Im gonna get-get him!

Heavy metal hour on T.V.

God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless the blue and god lighten me

And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

[Verse 3]
Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me

[Chorus]
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For then, a dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?

When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins, blue 50's song
The veranda look so shimmer
Neon palm sway

What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grow
And so I bid you farewell
<END TEXT>
They call me firecracker cause I sparkle, sparkle
Ah, they call me sunshine in the dark I glow like neon gold, neon gold
On the dance floor, dance floor
I'm your midnight answer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
I put my eyes on you, eyes on you
In it to win
So I drop it like it's hot on the pole, sin sin

They call me firecracker 'cause I'm danger, danger
They say that I'm like crack because my taste will change ya
I'm neon gold, I'm neon gold
Go-go dancer, dancer
Light me up that cancer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
Put my eyes on you, eyes on you
I'm in it to win
So I drop it like it's hot on the pole, spin spin

You know I love you, right?
What else you looking for?
I am the go-go girl next door, door
I won't take no, no
For an answer
I'm in to win it
Let me be your private dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
Put my eyes on you, eyes on you
In it to win
So I drop it like it's hot in the night club pole
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
Spin, spin

[Verse 1]
You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do
You're unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

[Chorus]
One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Verse 2]
You got the world but baby at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define
It isn't that hard boy to like you or love you
I'd follow you down down down
You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down down down, anywhere anywhere

[Chorus]
One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Instrumental Bridge]

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey
I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Outro]
I don't know
You're screwed up, you're brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

[Verse 1]
Have you ever seen a dead man?
A dead man lying in the road
Have you ever heard his best friend?
His best friend say you'd better go
Before you get fined
Or else you'll do time

[Chorus]
Oh its all about money, money
Money hunny
Its all about money, money
Well alright

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen an old man?
Seen an old man living all alone
Have you ever heard an old man?
Heard an old man hear the way he moans?
Because he's so tired
Because he just got fired

Oh its all about money, money
Money hunny

Feelin' like the world is weighing
Down on me again
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ooh

Have you ever seen a broke man
Seen a broke man begging for his life?
Have you ever heard a broke man
Heard a broke man, heard the pain & strife?
In his one line plea, in his dull edged knife

He asking for money money yeah money hunny
He asking for money money well alright

[Verse 1]
You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?
You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all

[Chorus]
I want money, power, and glory
I want money, and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

[Verse 2]
The sun also rises on those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run

[Chorus]
I want money, power, and glory
I want money, and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

[Verse 1]
I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution

[Chorus 1]
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

[Verse 2]
I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end

[Bridge]
You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers

[Chorus]
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

Drive down the main drag in your pontiac heaven
You can drink and drive, whatever you want to
And we'll get right down to it, me and you boo

We're layin' on the hood like it's a flatbed truck
In the spotlight we see Jim and Chuck
Saw that car from a mile away and it's slowin'
"They say that there's a motel dance, let's get going."

Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Play them like guitars, you're like one of my toys
(Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, Ive been sent to destroy, yeah

Hoes with lies akin to me

I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I had found you
Once I had you
I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please don't leave
It's all happening

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last youre beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams
I never knew I find somebody like you
Like you

My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under 40 and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard, so

[Chorus]
I'm gonna take you on
I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

[Verse 2]
My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair's exactly what I like the best
And my momma, she would say you was a hoodlum
But I'd done known a hoodlum and you don't pass the test

[Chorus]

Oh Baby, you're standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know I'm over and done now
I am done now

[Verse 3]
My momma would say that it was wrong to see you
I lied just to meet you, I lied to get in
My momma, she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you've got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

[Verse 4]
My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she ever saw you, she'd be smitten too

I'll never take you home
I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm gonna take you on
I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
he was the only one for me.
We both knew it, right away.
And as the years went on, things got more difficult --
we were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay. Try to remember what
we had at the beginning. He was charismatic, magnetic,
electric and everybody knew it. When he walked in
every woman's head turned, everyone stood up
to talk to him. He was like this hybrid, this mix of
a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn
between being a good person and
missing out on all of the opportunities that life could
offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way I understood him
and I loved him.
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him.
I love him.

So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, Upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."

Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
("Yes, of course I will my darling.")

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem

Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

[Interlude 2]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]

Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe in the land of
Sweetness and danger --
Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now.)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown.)
Red, white, blue's in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby
Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

[Verse 1]
Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go

[Verse 2]
All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's have a real good gig
Hey, you never know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on

[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Play your four-to-the floor, will you walk my way?
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Verse 3]
We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
LA's gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go

[Verse 4]
Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause baby we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on

[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Play your four-to-the floor, will you walk my way?
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

[Bridge]
I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?"

[Chorus 2]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Who can count on my love more than anyone
Never let me go

[Chorus 1]
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Play your four-to-the floor, will you walk my way?
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking

Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done

Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?

[Verse 1]
Walking is an art, so is my body
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips of the Bacardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness
He says "Who the best?" You is!

I'm glamorous, famous
Notorious, dangerous, "but you're crazy"

[Chorus]
"I'm gonna leave you,"
He said, "You're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you, we're through."

[Verse 2]
You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly
Party favor favorite of them all
He says "Baby doll is so sick"
Sick off your naughtiness-ness-ness-ness-ness

Let's go to Vegas
He say "who the best?"
He said "She is, she is but, yo
She crazy like in every single way
Like a hurricane
You gotta get out of the way
But she's hot, and she's cold
And she's cool and she's bold
And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo"

[Bridge]
Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous dangerous
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy

[Chorus]
He's gonna hate me
He wants a real girl
I'm like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said "We're through"

[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sitting, sipping on your Black Cristal, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted,
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

[Verse 2]
My old man is a tough man
But hes got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slipping on my red dress, putting on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted,
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

[Chorus 2]
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

[Bridge]
My old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when he may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said "hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"

[Chorus 3]
And were off to the races, places
Ready set the gate is down
And now were going in
To Las vegas, chaos
Casino oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy, youre so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

[Outro]
You are my one true love

[Verse 1]
Oh say can you see
My stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours

[Verse 2]
The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says
"Come as you are"
And I will
Nighttime is almost ours

[Verse 3]
The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost ours

[Verse 1]
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

[Verse 2]
The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine?
From words but not from beauty
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

[Bridge]
And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

[Outro]
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty

[Verse 1]
You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think youre so cool, babe
Loving everything you do

[Pre-Chorus]
You say were gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway

[Chorus]
Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, were going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

[Verse 2]
You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip-gloss
How you get so hot?
Youre making me crazy
Hoping youll never stop

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
You say that we were meant to be
Well be together finally
Flying around and Im finally free

[Chorus]

[Bridge x4]
Were on our way

[Verse 3]
Why do I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because youre the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My troubles all over now
Because youre my man

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
You dont know what youve done to me
Youre heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now

[Outro]
Were on our way...

You tell me not to worry
Because youre the boss

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

[Bridge]
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream

Ooh baby, can't you hear our favorite song?
Ooh baby, make me wait a bit too long

I don't ever want to stop, show me everything you got
I've done this before, and I should know better
Ooh baby, what planet are you on?
What ya waiting for? What ya waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me finally?
Are you ready now?

Ooh baby, look at all your high-brow friends
Ooh baby thinkin' I don't understand

Cuz I'm drinkin' diet coke a lot, sucking on my lollipops
I know that I'm not that grown up, but no one's better
Ooh baby, when you gonna be my man?
What ya waitin for? What ya waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?

You tell me that you love me

Wanna put your hands on me?
Say that there's a chance for me?

[Chorus - Variation]
I'm the other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 1]
You you, la-la-lie
You you, la-la-lie
Who else knows you're not a stand up guy?
Trouble in paradise, they can see it in your eyes
Living double lives, yeah your living double lives

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He says he loves me, I don't believe him
If I'm so angry, why don't I leave him?
But he knows that I, I really need him
I'm tired of being, tired of being

[Chorus]
The other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 2]
Chase that high, chase that high
Is there nothing that will satisfy?
There's trouble inside your mind, and you're desperate for the fire
Addicted to surprise, addicted to the lies

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he wants me, why can't I see him?
Only at late nights, not on the weekend
I know his tough life, I know his girlfriend
I'm tired of hearing, hearing he's leaving

[Chorus]
That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 3]
At the supermarket, waiting in line
Hair done, nails on, gold design
She walks up and whispered from behind
"Everyone knows your little secret"

[Bridge]
I'm the other woman
Everyone's bridesmaid, nobody's bride
Everyone's mistress, nobody's wife
But we knew when you moved that you were the troubled type
You the kinda girl who, you the kinda girls

[Chorus]
That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman

[Verse 1]
Little bits and pieces fall into the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

[Chorus]
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

[Verse 2]
Smiles from a stranger, seem to change your day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is how I feel when all my hurt is over

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

[Chorus]
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again

Want you like I never wanted anyone
Got a face like God and a bod' like Tron
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone
Cause you keep it really rough like, oh my God

You make my heart go pow

Coming down like pouring rain

[Intro]
Baby, say goodnight, text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating

[Verse 1]
You're sittin' in your office, dreamin' of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now, we're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walkin' home from school, my thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight and take off to a different place?
Don't tell my daddy why, gotta get on that plane and just fly

[Chorus]
Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris, we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris

[Verse 2]
I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go while we're young
Cause one day, we will want to rewind

[Chorus]
Our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris, make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Wanna go out every night
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris, we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris

[Bridge]
Walking through the streets at dawn, we dance by empty carousels
Singin' at the Sacr-Cur, and climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars, we are, we are
Dreaming (Of Paris)

[Chorus]
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris, make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Wanna go out every night
Promise we won't say goodbye

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

[Verse 1]
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go

[Chorus]
Oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Oh-ohh

[Verse 2]
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

[Chorus]
Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no

[Bridge]
I can't do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

[Outro]
Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world

Not of this world
Not of this world

They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground

[Verse 1]
Okay, lets go, 1234
No I'm vintage, no I don't care
No I'm not Kylie, no, you can't compare me to another one
There's no one else, I'm nobody, I'm just myself
It's not Fight Club, I'm a rare snowflake
But if I hear you bringing me down, calling me so fake
I will fight you (yes), I will fight you (yes)
Because in the end, there's only truth and God is gonna smite you
Besides that, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive

[Chorus]
They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

Pre-Chorus
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
No I'm not retro, no I'm not fair
And yes, I like to re-record and dance in underwear
And its not Scarface cause I'mma live forever
And if I hear from anyone you're trying to get too clever
Then I will fight you, I will win, I will rise again, soar in the wind
It's my destiny, the way my life begins
So if you're in my way, I'll knock you down like kingpin

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines

[Verse 3]
I'm wearing the invisible crown
You can't see it yet
Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep

[Chorus]

Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines

Everybody knows I'm a good girl officer
No I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar
(Well) I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late?
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my night gown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?

Looking at me, then suddenly
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

Let's get back in your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl?
I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting have you
Ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting
Don't you think?

I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you, desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you, desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Lovin' hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

Pretty baby, if you dont like the way that I touch you
Then I wont touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby if you dont like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

[Chorus]
My mean daddy, my bad baby
Dont you want me?
I dont believe you when you say
You want to leave

Darling, honey, if you dont think that you're gonna want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I dont wanna keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you dont

[Chorus]

Aren't you gonna miss me?
Honey, Ill miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight

Pretty baby, if you dont like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you dont like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

[Verse 1]
All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I that girl that you dream of
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you, babe, that's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe, you never do

[Chorus]
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

[Verse 2]
All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
I wait for you, babe, you don't come through, babe
You never do, babe, that's just what you do

[Chorus]
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

[Bridge]
Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You leave last, you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

[Chorus - Variation]
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry

[Verse 1]
Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "Be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star I've ever seen
And I never dreamed I'd be so happy that I could die

[Vesre 2]
You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say, "back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and that I'm very cherry bomb
And even then I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in hall like "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like "let's go, let's go"

[Chorus]
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Verse 3]
If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

[Verse 4]
You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say "shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls and then my first Nirvana song
So even then when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in hall like "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like "let's go, let's go"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know that they say that all I want is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Chorus]

Golden sand between my toes

You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

When you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold m and trust me babe

What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Set my soul on fire, make me wild like the deep blue sea

No other boy ever made me feel beautiful
When I'm in your arms, feels like I have it all
Is it your tattoos or golden grill that makes me feel this way?

[Chorus]
Got me spinning like a ballerina
Feeling gangsta every time I see ya
You're the king and baby
I'm the queen of disaster, disaster
Got me spinning like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster

[Verse 2]
Got mascara thick, I get emotional
You know, I was more than just a party girl
Isn't hard to see what's going on, I'm so far gone
(Mmm, so far gone)

When I saw your face, it was incredible
Pin it on my soul, it was indelible (my soul)
Let's celebrate our twisted fate, we're the broken ones

Ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time....

But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station

Give me coffee, Utah love
I'm the kind of girl you dream of
And I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
With slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably with smoking inside
If you can swing it
And I'd be real pleased if we could find one just like it
Again (x12)

When all my friends say I should take some space
Well I can't envision that for a minute

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

Everything is bright now, no more cloudy days
Even when the storms come, in the eye we'll stay

Oh baby, when you call me, I come to

You're making me crazy, oh little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle
Make me smile

[Chorus]
Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Oh honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile

I'll never forget it, oh you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance

New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made

[Chorus Variation]
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitment is
The bane of my existence

True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid

[Pre-Song]
I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times

I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didnt really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is

When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but theres no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head

I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing me due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didnt plan for it to turn out this way Id be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldnt even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

[Song]

[Post-Song]
Every night I used to pray that Id find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art

Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun

I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
"I believe in the kindness of strangers"

And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride

Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?

I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full time baby, hot or cold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride

[Verse 2]
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
Thats the way the road dogs do it
Light til dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride

[Bridge]
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

[Chorus]
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride
Just ride, I just ride, I just ride

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
I want to be your object, of your affection
Give me all your time, touch, money, and attention
Pick me up after school, you can be my baby
Maybe we could go somewhere, get a little crazy
He's rich and I'm wishin', um, he could be my Mister Yum
Delicious to the maximum, chew him up like bubble gum
I'm his pretty party favor, he says I'm his favorite flavor

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, uh, catch me ridin' like a bitch
Got the six forty-five, catch me ridin' with my bitch
Uh, long hair, Lana, that's my bitch
Uh, You can tell by the swagger and the lips, uh
Uh, uh, catch me ridin' like a bitch
Got the six forty-five, catch me ridin' with my bitch
Uh, long hair, Lana, that's my bitch
Uh, You can tell by the swagger and the lips, uh

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
You say that I am flawless, true perfection
So give me all your drugs, props, money, and connections
Pick me up after school, actin' kinda shady
You're the coolest kid in town, I'm your little lady
You're sick and I'm kissin' him, magical musician, how I'm
Drivin' at the cinema, lovin' him and lickin' him
He's my lovely life saver
Doesn't mind my bad behavior

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, uh, catch me ridin' like a bitch
Got the six forty-five, catch me ridin' with my bitch
Uh, long hair, Lana, that's my bitch
Uh, You can tell by the swagger and the lips, uh
Uh, uh, catch me ridin' like a bitch
Got the six forty-five, catch me ridin' with my bitch
Uh, long hair, Lana, that's my bitch
Uh, You can tell by the swagger and the lips, uh

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Swervin', swervin', gettin' all them dimes
Tell her I be doin', I be swaggin' to my prime
This ain't all the time, it happens all the time
That's a big contradiction, get your money on your mind
What, what, tell her I be on a chase
Chasin' for that paper and you see me on that race
What, what, tell her I be goin' first
I be gon' first and they put me in a hearse, oh
One big room, full of bad bitches, no
One big room and it's full of mad bitches
Lana, Lana, tell them what it is
Tell 'em that you doin' it, you mean to do it big
I said, one big room, full of bad bitches, no it's
One big room and it's full of mad bitches, I said
Lana, Lana, tell them what it is
Tell 'em when you do it that you only do it big

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, uh, catch me ridin' like a bitch
Got the six forty-five, catch me ridin' with my bitch
Uh, long hair, Lana, that's my bitch

Lilacs in my mind all the time are blooming beautifully
Even though some stare and say her last affair went brutally
Well I don't let them rain on my parade
That's not my thing
'Cause I've got love on my side, now
I've got nothing to hide, now
And now life's a dream
Life's a dream

[Intro: (Unknown) & Lana Del Rey]
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Uh, this love is dead)

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You always buy me roses when Im mad
Do you think Ill forgive you just like that?
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah?
Im not letting you off easy, Im still sad

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Im kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriends keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
Im missing you hard, give you my softcore babyface
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and its fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that youre mine
Ill let you off easy, its alright
And then you buy me roses and its fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that youre mine
Ill let you off easy, its alright

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
You always buy me roses like a creep
Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be?
If you still want my love then work for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & (Unknown)]
Youre kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and its fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that youre mine
Ill let you off easy, its alright
And then you buy me roses and its fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that youre mine
Ill let you off easy, its alright

[Verse 3: Unknown]
We had conversations, aint nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and its fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that youre mine
Ill let you off easy, its alright
And then you buy me roses and its fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that youre mine
Ill let you off easy, its alright

[Outro: Unknown]
See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is dead

[Verse 1]
Being a mistress on the side
It might not appeal to fools like you
Creeping around on the side
Would not be something you would do

[Pre-Chorus]
But, you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

[Verse 2]
Being a bad bitch on the side
Might not appeal to fools like you
Creeping around while he gets high
It might not be something you would do

[Pre-Chorus]
But, you haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen my man
You haven't seen him

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

[Bridge]
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
I'm on fire, baby
I'm on fire

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

I'm a sad girl

Ruby, blue and green, neon too

The summer's wild
And I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see, you're meant for me?
The summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt your Medelln tangerine dreams

[Bridge]
Catch me if you can, working on my tan, salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain, ciao amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat soft ice cream

Chorus: Lana Del Rey

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much

Verse 1: Malcolm Anthony (K Theory)

Murder me love, damn girl
I was supposed to be your, man girl
I thought we had, plans girl
I guess that all changed
Been sucking on my blood
Cuz I forgot to check for fangs
She a monster, cold hearted
The female dexter, who's next up?
No I'm not the last to get the
Wrath or the pressure
It seems its all fate
But when you livin in her thrill
You might die during the chase
She's a killer!
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Wish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too?

[Hook]
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

[Breakdown]
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much

Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

[Verse 2]
My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires?"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do

[Hook]
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath

You know I love the thrill of the rush

La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Just have fun

[Verse 1]
My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Verse 2]
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women too
I'm one of many; one is blue
And when he calls, he calls for me, and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Bridge]
Your hot, hot weather in the summer
Hot, hot, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
Hot, neglectful lover
Youre crumbling, sadly
You're sadly crumbling

[Chorus]
Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.

[Intro]
Down, down, down
Mm, Uh-huh
Huh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
When you got her in the back seat
Drivin' round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
(Do you remember my name?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is she a Ride-or-Die Bitch?
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

[Chorus]
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

[Verse 2]
When you take her to Chateau Marmont
Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
Is she a Ride-or-Die Bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am

[Chorus]
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

[Bridge]
You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curveball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)

[Chorus]
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

Do I make you feel like Christmas time?
Put me in a party dress one time
Love me 'til I see the sunshine
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

[Chorus x2]
Who has a face like smarty does?
Who has a voice like smarty does?
Who has a choice like smarty does?
Nobody, nobody

Say I make you feel like christmas time
Say I make you feel like christmas time
Tell me you don't feel like christmas time
Put me in a party dress one time

[Verse 1]
Baby, if you loved me, you would call me your bunny
Tell me that I'm just a baby, honey
Beat me and tell me no one will love me
Better than you do
Better than you do
Dance me all around the room
Dance me around the room
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Dance me all around the room
Say you'll never leave me

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
Say I make you feel like
Like you did, like you did, when you were thirteen
Say I make you feel like
When you were the dirty heavy metal king

[Breakdown]
Say I make you feel all right, all right, all right
Kissing me till I see the sunshine
Kissing me till I see the sunshine
Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little girl is yours tonight
Is yours tonight
This little girl is yours tonight
Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

Smile though you heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking

If you just smile

You were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But theyre really not shit, I dont get it
Youre looking like a man, youre talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial, crazy
I dont get it, your taste once exquisite

What happened to Brooklyn? What happened to New York
What happened to my scene? What happened to punk rock, rock

You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me
I dont get it, Im so legit

Tell me, was it cause I wasnt platinum in jewels?
That perhaps you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it?

Stefani, you suck, I know youre selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
Youre hurt, I know my words dont hurt you

Oh, girl, I see you walking round in your pearls
Thinking that youre number one
Youre so funny, cause honey, youre not

What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where, no magic in the air

What happened to Brooklyn? What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous and we were born bad
And we were born bad?

Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face and girls were walking around wasted
And everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rock

[Verse 1]
Standing on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy
Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high

He wishes to be seen with me
In his limousine
And he says we'll have a real good time
Well X-X-O but I want you to know

[Hook]
Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight
It's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl
And I'm just warning you

You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
(1) I won't fall in love
(2) I won't ever stop
(3) I'm partying all night
(4) I'm gonna make it pop

[Verse 2]

Kissing on your light yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n roll
On an island hotspot
Maybe we should dot dot dot
(Lose control)

Do you think it's really mean
That I'm only on the scene
Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well X-X-O but I told you so

[Hook]

But it's not about us
Just forget about us
Tonight

Put your cigarette down
Baby light up the town
Beside me

You don't get it
You just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it

Life doesnt always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I just cant understand it
All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesnt matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye, baby

Oh, boy, youre starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
Youve got heaven in your eyes

I had a man; he was sweet as pie
I met him as I waked right by him
He said, "Baby you so fine that when you walk
Even the stoplights stop talk about you
I saw you and I had to make you mine
Cause you ultimately the most fine
You know a man like me
Gotta have a woman that's killer
She's got a be killer, killer, killer, baby."

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

The way you talk, well, you make me smile
And I'm lookin' down cause I'm kinda shy
You know you're so fine that when you talk
Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

There's something about you when you say
Come on, come on with me babe.
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow

Fly body, dont mean a thing
Fly body, dont mean a thing
Fly body, dope in the face

You're gonna be the, youre gonna be the
Youre gonna be the death of me
(Yes you are, you are.)

You so fly, you so dope, babe
You so fly, you so dope, babe

Fly like a bird

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

[Verse 1]
It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled off
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You took me to the edge
Of town, that's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

[Bridge]
You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you'll be fine

[Chorus]

Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this

We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

[Verse 1: Barrie James O'Neill]
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Verse 2: Barrie James O'Neill]
My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine

When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes (in my eyes)
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size(in my eyes, uh)
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime(Uh, Uh)
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oh, uh, Summer wine

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavenly, deadly on the grind
Cause to sing this nice has to be a crime
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi

I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard to stay far, far away from me
Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch boy
Stay away from me

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh on the far east side
Baby I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'll be tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
Cause I'm hot like that when I walk, they die
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Like bye, bye

Please excuse m-my vivacity, capacity for hating
Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy step away from me

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side
Baby I'm a tenement girl
Keepin' it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby I'm a dangerous girl
Baby, you should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
Happily
Murdering and murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering and murdering 'em

I'm diggable, predicatable
No, everyone knows all my people
Ill give you a fistful
You know youll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If youre lookin for fun you can come out with me tonight

I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, ya liking what you see? Yup!

Baby I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it sweet, on the far east side

Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?

Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue

You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd

Nothing could stop the two of us
Let's just get lost, that's what we want

It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song

Dive in, dive deep and in dark blue my sweet
Brushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything

If that's what we want, we could just get lost

Ponte tus zapatillas blancas y sgueme
Porque trabajas tan duro, cuando podras solo ser libre?
Tienes tu momento ahora, ya conseguiste tu legado
Dejemos el mundo por los que cambian todo
Nada nos podr detener
Vamos a perdernos, eso es lo que queremos

Y yo nunca voy a cantar de nuevo
Y tu no vas a trabajar un da mas
No cantare mas
Con una sola ola que desaparece
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne
Es nuestra cancin de cisne
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne

Querido, sumrgete en la gamuza profunda y azul
Corriendo desde donde se encuentran el agua y el hielo
Te has ido tanto tiempo, perdiste todo
El mundo puede cambiar en un da si tu te vas
Pero nada nos podra detener
Eso es lo que queremos
Perdamosnos

Y yo nunca voy a cantar de nuevo
Y tu no vas a trabajar un da mas
No cantare mas
Con una sola ola que desaparece
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne
Es nuestra cancin de cisne
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne

Vive tu vida
Vive tu vida, donde has estado
Donde te vas (te vas)
Di buenas noches
Di buenas noches a la vida en el mundo donde vivimos
Estoy siguindote

Y yo nunca voy a cantar de nuevo
Y tu no vas a trabajar un da mas
No cantare mas
Con una sola ola que desaparece
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne
Es nuestra cancin de cisne
Sera nuestra cancin de cisne

Ponte tus zapatillas blancas y sgueme
Porque trabajas tan duro, cuando podras solo ser libre?
Tienes tu momento ahora, ya conseguiste tu legado
Dejemos el mundo por los que cambian todo
Nada nos podr detener
Vamos a perdernos, eso es lo que queremos

[Intro]
Uh, hm, uh
Com'on
Com'on

[Verse 1]
I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
(My battle lines look like paradise next to you)
I hope I remember you just like that
Lookin' fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
(Your stupid lines, they're like dynamite)

[Pre-Chorus]
The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure

[Chorus]
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

[Verse 2]
I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say "you're beautiful, but hopeless"
("Come on inside oh, you crazy child, look at you")
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quotin' Corleone, like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra cause it's our thing
(I made you mine, like a thousand times)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say "I'm sure."

[Chorus]
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

[Bridge]
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

[Chorus]
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

[Verse 1]
You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow cold

[Chorus]
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

[Verse 2]
But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee to what you are not

[Chorus]
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes

[Bridge]
I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
But I'm putting all the lights on in the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom

[Chorus]
Well I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes

[Outro]
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1]
Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Post-Chorus]
Because I'm going deeper and deeper
Harder and harder
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god

[Verse 2]
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Post-Chorus]
Because I'm going deeper and deeper
Harder and harder
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god

[Bridge]
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Outro]
It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again

Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Good morning, morning, hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move on that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?

Just one more minute, that's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love wakin' up next to me
As much as I love wakin' up next to you?

Well you make the coffee and I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch and you'll fix mine
Now tell me the truth, do these old shoes look funny?
Honey, it's almost nine

Now you be careful, gotta go
I love you, have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Skip-a-dee-doo-dah
Thank you Lord for making him for me
And thank you for making life turn out
The way I always thought it should be

There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

[Verse 1]
All that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off of bridges
Sparklers and streamers, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

[Verse 2]
All that's real to me is Halloween and Jesus
Coney Island beaches
Chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

[Chorus]
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

[Verse 3]
All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama freezes
Platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

[Verse 1]
The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere

[Verse 2]
The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

[Bridge]
And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine

[Verse 3]
The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman
Will spend her life alone, alone, alone
Hooo hooo hooo , babyy doo dooo ah ah, ah ahh , whooo hoo hooo alonee

[Verse 1]
Little boy
Living without you won't be easy to do
Little boy
You are the love of my life
And if you don't wanna talk to me
Well, then I think that's alright

[Chorus]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

[Verse 2]
Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

[Bridge]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

[Chorus]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always

[Verse 3]
Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend

[Chorus]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

[Verse 1]
Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen, and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi!"
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry
Mascara running' down her little Bambi eyes:
"Lana, how I hate those guys."

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

[Verse 2]
And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen, and we had arrived
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yo, we used to go break into the hotel pool
Glimmering, wed swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, "Get us while we're hot. Get us while we're hot"
(C'mon, take a shot)

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

[Bridge]
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair, and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying cause I know I'm never coming back

[Chorus]
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something' that we'd die for, it's our curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen

[Intro]
You know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing, and trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon, and missed, than me

[Verse 1]
It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself, life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your 'Why not's'
I bought your bullshit all before, now you trying to sell me more, babe?

[Chorus]
Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am, smiling, but I ain't happy

[Chorus]
Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm so far gone, I can't turn off my mind
It's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
Haunting day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?

[Verse 3]
I've felt this way before I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop
I keep running around the same town, knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?

[Chorus]
A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
"Hey, what you doin'?" Not a lot
Shakin' and movin' at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey]
Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

[Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Verse 2: Sean Lennon]
Hey, what you thinkin'? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

[Pre-Chorus 2: Sean Lennon]
Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

[Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, both]
Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singin' with Sean
Whoa

[Chorus 2: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I could keep waitin' for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pourin' rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came (no, no, no)
Tomorrow never came (no, no)
Tomorrow never came (no, no, no)
Tomorrow never came

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 1]
I do my hair up, all high and wide
White flowers tied
Green swimming pool, pink flamingo, high Christmas lights
Blue bed spread and silver tinsel
My heart's delight

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 2]
Do you like my fake nails daddy?
Black palm tree, pink tiger stripes
Used to go to the Palm Parade, yeah
Where you'd buy me a slice of cherry pie
We didn't know much, just worked at night
Sweet trailer life
One, two

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Verse 3]
He said, "Lana Rey, will you serve me lemonade?"
I said, "Yes Bill, I will, it's the day of the parade"
And you look even more handsome than you did the day that I left you"
How do you spend your nights, honey, still watching TV?
I long to be in your arms, honey
Come back to me, please

[Chorus]
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

[Bridge]
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
You know, hmmm
Come on now, if you want to
If you want to
If you want to
If you want to
It's been a long time

[Chorus]
Boy you wanna come to my motel honey?
Boy you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
(In my motel, honey)
Boy, you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

Body Electric

I sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, (Man you've got to be crazy!)
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul

Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
O I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
O I say now these are the Soul!

Gods and Monsters

- "You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?"
- "Yeah.."
- "So just chill, alright?"
- "Mhmm"
- "Alright.."
- "Yeah."

(Just remember, I'm always there for you.)

(Dialog Birthday Party w/ Strippers)

I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares

(Robbery)

And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost

(Praying)

(You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky

- John Wayne)

Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night-time
Clichs find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

A dark room in the night-time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot - lacklustre

He'll try tonight
To not get high
He'll try tonight
To not get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he will

If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Verse 2]
If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know you get scared sometimes boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions but that's all right

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white

He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

Reminded me of when we were kids
Reminded me of when we were kids

That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Chorus]
With his Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that Ultraviolence

[Verse 2]
He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

[Chorus]
With his Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that Ultraviolence

[Bridge]
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, babe
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

[Interlude (Spoken)]
I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

[Chorus]
With his Ultraviolence (lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (in my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera Girls)
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that Ultraviolence

[Verse 1]
I was addicted to you, but I didn't know it
You were afflicted by booze
You didn't show it, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
"This is so like you," I said
Put yourself on back to bed

[Chorus]
You're like crack to me, I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
Staying with him till the morning

You're like crack to me, so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
Gonna watch him till the morning

[Verse 2]
I was addicted to you, didn't wanna blow it
You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out, nothing left
Burned yourself out, nothing left

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Styrofoam on the microphone
Can't give it up, can't go it alone
Flame-colored paradise for you, darling
But death doesn't come with a warning

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death

[Chorus]

[Outro]
My baby's on his last life, darling
Gonna stay with him till morning
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
And death doesn't come with a warning

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say, Get over here
And play a video game

I'm in his favourite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favourite perfume on
Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now you do, now you do, now you do

[Verse 1]
He was a big wave surfer
Living down by Waimea bay
We had a few friends
Never thought it would end
I remember an all white day
With eight story waves
He said, "Your eyes are grey" (Beautiful)
We were living on Coeur d'Alene
On Carol lane, sun Manta Ray

[Chorus]
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

[Verse 2]
I remember we came in May
And we changed our names to Lana and Rey
We'd be up 'til the sun rose, ay
I'm in gold Lam, your pink floral haze

[Chorus]
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

Wait a little longer kid
What you want to grow up so fast for?
Why you doing like I did?
Didn't you say I got what I asked for?

But you're afraid to find out
Like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?

And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet
I know that you want everything

That's what you told me
I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you and I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it then
I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you?
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you

And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much

Girls, don't forget your pearls and all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls and all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the frightened)

[Chorus 1]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Verse 2]
Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the frightened)

[Chorus 1]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Bridge]
(And we'll do it again)
Oh my god, dizzy from lovin' you
And we'll do it again
Oh my god, dizzy from lovin' you
We'll do it again
Did it from, did it from lovin' you
We'll do it again
In a world at war

[Chorus 2]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Outro]
And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again

[Verse 1]
Packin' all my things for the summer
Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Verse 2]
Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Bridge]
You're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

[Chorus]
White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild mustang

[Outro]
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

[Verse 1]
Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous?
Tell me, am I glamorous?

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Verse 2]
Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined my heart
But burned into my brain are these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it?
Babe, that life we could've lived

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Bridge]
We were two kids just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
But when we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope
Your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

[Outro]
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have you

[Verse 1]
I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo, yeah you, yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo, how now, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
50's baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

[Verse 2]
I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggie, like I told you
Yayo, yeah you, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
50's baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

[Bridge]
Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark night (dark night)
Yayo, yeah you, yayo

[Chorus]
Put me onto your black motorcycle
50's baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

[Verse 1]
If you dance I'll dance
And if you don't I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

[Chorus]
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

[Verse 2]
If you go I'll stay
You come back I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm I stay clear

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

[Chorus]
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

[Verse 3]
If you dance I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on again
And if you fight I'll fight
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

[Chorus]
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

[Intro]
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I dont know why

[Verse 1]
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Dont let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Dont let it stop

[Chorus]
He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, Do you want it?
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, Im beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it

[Pre-Chorus]
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

[Chorus]

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Dont let it stop

[Verse 2]
He has a white corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, know, I saw it
Hes bleeding from his brain and his wallet
Hes sick and hes taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just cant resist
As close as Ill get to the darkness
He tells me to, Shut up, I got this

[Pre-Chorus]
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

[Chorus]
You can be the boss, daddy

I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
Youre wrong but youre so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean
To keep 'em keen
But you, you're not that nice
But you taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

[Chorus]
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce

[Verse 1]
Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the beach
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos, they were glistening
It's been so long since someone made me different

[Chorus]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
Its just you and the sun, its just you and the sun now baby

[Verse 2]
Gonna light up the skies, I can see it
You're Gods favorite child, boy, believe it
Try hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanide
Diamonds and getting blazed
Your tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

[Chorus]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
Its just you and the sun, its just you and the sun now baby

[Bridge]
I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspired
Make me higher and higher

[Chorus]
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
Its just you and the sun, its just you and the sun now baby

[Verse 1]
I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I

[Chorus]
Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I

[Chorus]
Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

[Outro]
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that you'll let him in
Father tell me if you can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

I think we're losing what we used to have, you know
You loved me better one year ago, oh
Don't let me down, don't let me down so low

But I won't be ashamed if you leave me
I won't be all that mad if you go
Cause I know, yes I know

You always spending all that stupid time
With your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I've been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want

And I won't be ashamed to take you back in
Won't be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
Cause I know, I know

Boy, don't call me up quickly on the phone
It's been five nights since I heard the tone of your voice
You act like everything's alright
But we both know, we both know that it's not
And it's far from ever being good again
I'm gonna love you forever
If you come back, I'll take you back in baby
Back in, baby, back in, back in

I love you more than I will even know
You're so special
I guess that's why you got it where you go
But when you get real big, baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that Red River Valley
Waiting back in that Tallahassee
I love you

[Verse 1]
Carry me off stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years, is that enough for you boy?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

[Chorus]
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

[Verse 2]
Carry me off stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Carry me to my bed, lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we were not know

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another
[Bridge: Unleaked Version]
Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh You and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl

[Verse 1]
Jerry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel
And thats because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That hes ever seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What'd God give me a brain for?
He wont help me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
If he wont help me do it?

[Chorus]
Youre gonna love me
Im gonna make you
Youre gonna love me
Im gonna make you

[Verse 2]
Well I can tell that youre the type
To never trust a beauty queen
But I was never voted for nothing
And high school never meaned
Anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when Im funny
You think Im acting, so I say

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What'd God give me a brain for
If he wont let me use it?
Whatd God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it

[Chorus]
Youre gonna love me
Im gonna make you
Youre gonna love me
Im gonna make you

You say that you dont want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I dont want to hypnotize you
Theres nothing from you that I want to take
I just want to be like you
(Maybe love you just a little bit)
Please

Jim, I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way
Thats exactly what Im gonna do

Im going to strike out, right now
Im striking out right now with this song
But I cant help myself;
I cant do right for long
You know that

[Pre-Chorus 3]
What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for
He never lets me do it

[Chorus]
Youre gonna love me
Im gonna make you
Youre gonna love me
Im gonna make you
