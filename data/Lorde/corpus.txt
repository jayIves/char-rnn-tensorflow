[Verse 1]
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
Till the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Verse 2]
Now we're wearing long sleeves
And the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front

[Pre-Chorus]
You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Bridge]
We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you?
Till the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do, let me kill it with you

[Chorus]
(And I like you)
I love these roads where the houses don't change
(And I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say
(And I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway
(And I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

[Outro]
And I like you...
And I like you...
I like you

[Verse 1]
That slow burn waits while it gets dark
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb

[Verse 2]
We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue
But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking

[Chorus]
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

[Verse 3]
All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks
But people are talking, people are talking
But not you
But people are talking, people are talking

[Chorus]
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

[Post-Chorus]
All the double-edged people into schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
A world alone, we're all alone

[Bridge]
I know we're not everlasting
We're a trainwreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still, get still
People are talking, people are talking...

[Chorus]
Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

[Post-Chorus]
All the double-edged people into schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
A world alone, we're all alone

[Outro]
But people are talking, people are talking...
But people are talking, people are talking...
But people are talking, people are talking...
Let 'em talk

What else should I be? All apologies
What else could I say? Everyone is gay
What else could I write? I don't have the right
What else should I be? All apologies
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
I wish I was like you easily amused
Find my nest of salt, everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezerburn, choking on the ashes of her enemy
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, married
Married, buried
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

[Intro]
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

[Verse 1]
Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep, I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)

[Interlude]
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

[Verse 2]
Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep, I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)

[Verse 2]
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)

[Outro]
(It feels better biting down)
Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)

[Verse 1]
All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
Cause I was raised up to be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn, it's the closest thing to assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

[Chorus]
It's a switch flipped, it's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream, a collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size
I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I learned not to want the quiet of a room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go oh

[Beat Break]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well you laughed, baby, it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well you laughed, baby, it's okay)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Verse 2]
We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

[Chorus]
And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favourite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

[Bridge]
Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

[Chorus]
And I'll never go home again (place the call, feel it start)
Favourite friend (and nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun (and I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along (make-believe it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

[Verse 1]
Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

[Verse 2]
Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 3]
It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Chorus]
There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Verse 1]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, Im quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
Im done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
Were at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, theres so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Verse 2]
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
Im done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it ever ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
Were at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, theres so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Outro]
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat

[Verse 1]
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (oh!)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (oh!)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Verse 2]
Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (oh!)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (oh!)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold lie promises, we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, "Secretly you love this
Do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Theres no love, tell your friends
You dont really love them, but
You really love when
Braid your hair and give in
You can try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

[Chorus]
Oh, till it comes all this way, just two broken hearts
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you dont feel alright
Its alright, its alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

[Verse 2]
There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you dont get
Look it up when you get it
You can try to get in, but reject it again
Laugh it off again, I guess so well

[Chorus]
Oh, till it comes all this way, just two broken hearts
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you dont feel alright
Its alright, its alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

[Bridge]
Inquirers to bright green eyes
You still love to spend up time
Drop it like a call in the her lights out
Oh, we move side by side
Some times we play, we play and play and play
Examine love, freak face and we love
Oh, it's good again

[Chorus]
Oh, till it comes all this way, just two broken hearts
Oh, you can feel sorry for there are people in your mind
Oh, nothing feels close, even when you dont feel alright
Its alright, its alright
Everyone stay up like a good fight

[Verse 1: Lorde]
I do my makeup in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar

[Refrain: Lorde]
Those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus: Lorde]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Verse 2: Lorde (Chromeo)]
Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom (I wake up in a different bedroom, baby)
I whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you (The city sings 'em back to you, back to you)

[Refrain: Lorde]
All those rumors, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
On the light up floor

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But honey I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Chorus: Lorde]
'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Yes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

[Outro: Lorde]
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Hard Feelings

(Go back and tell it)

Please could you be tender
And I will sit close to you
Lets give it a minute before we admit that were through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
Im at Jungle City, its late and this song is for you

Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed ya when you told me this was my home

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When youve outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
Its time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I dont need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how wed drift buying groceries, how youd dance for me
Ill start letting go of little things 'til Im so far away from you, far away from you, yeah
Loveless

What is this tape?
This is my favorite tape
Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess what? I like that
Cause Im gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

Were L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S
Generation
L.O.V.E.L.E.S.S
Generation
All fuckin' with our lovers heads
Generation

Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well guess what? I like that

Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

[Verse 1: Lorde]
A couple rebel top gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, oh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lines
Seeing me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus: Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 2: Khalid]
I wanna feel the light, pushin' our limits
Unbuckled for the ride, mhmm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night
If the light is in the air
Open, finally, we're goin' and we're free

[Chorus: Khalid & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 3: SZA]
I checked your girl at the door
I sent your friend to the store
It's only me and you, finally us two
And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor, makin' you listen
Yeah, I know you don't know me well
My girl's at the door
And I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (goin' back)

[Chorus: SZA & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 4: Post Malone]
Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one
I know, I know we on to somethin'
We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me the look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus: All]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite, yeah, yeah
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowin' shit up

Now you know it's really gonna blow

Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 2]
Might get your friend to drive, but he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome
All the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your t-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right?

[Chorus]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Now you know it's really gonna blow

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Outro]
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Verse 1]
No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying
I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit
It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind
If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors always changing sides
They were friends of mine

[Verse 2]
Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom
All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

[Verse 3]
We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky
See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine?

[Verse 4]
Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying
To be
<END TEXT>
I'm a liability
I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no no no no...
Whatcha gonna do?
All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing woo-hoo
Maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe
Maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently

But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
Liability
But you're not what you thought you were
Much for me
But you're not what you thought you were

You leave
<END TEXT>
[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Baby really hurt me, crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking her cheek

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Verse 2]
The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting running through the night
But every perfect summer's eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

[Chorus]
They say, "You're a little much for me, you're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for e-a-na-na-na, everyone

[Outro]
They're gonna watch me disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me disappear into the sun
<END TEXT>
It's time to let the lost boys take you in

It's getting cold out
You let yourself down
So please don't go out
You're looking dead behind the eyes

We'll stay at your house
Watch all those late shows on TV...
I like it best when you're in here with me

And all the lost boys
We make a picture perfect team
Bruising sidewalks
With all the drumming of our feet
And boy, I promise
We'll never ever let you leave
Never let you leave

[Verse 1]
There's nothing I want but money in time
Million dollar bills in a tick tick tick tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
A limit in spite
Will do the trick trick trick trick

[Hook]
We can leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go

[Verse 2]
There's nothing as fun as coming untied
And running with the kids in the park park park park
There's nothing that's hurt like letting you go
It's like a bird eyes in the dark dark dark dark

[Hook]
We can leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cars go

[Bridge]
It's not about just being out with all our people
Cause we can get in trouble just by going free flow
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know and now I'm letting you know

[Verse 1]
We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to
And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath
The ceiling or a roof, try come out and steal our thunder

[Verse 2]
Now the days are getting cooler, and the burning of our limbs
Doesnt happen quite as bad as the burn is just skin
Deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter
Like the movies that we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel the subtle taste
Of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning
But you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

[Chorus] (x2)
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

[Bridge]
I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

[Chorus] (x4)
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

[Verse 1]
Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

[Pre-Break]
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?

[Break]
Go!

[Verse 2]
Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night
'Cause...

[Pre-Break]
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Verse 2]
Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes

[Verse 1: Lorde]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus 1: Lorde]
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

[Verse 2: Lorde]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Pre-Chorus: Lorde]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

[Chorus 2: Lorde]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

[Bridge: Lorde]
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em-

[Outro: Lorde]
You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)
You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

[Verse 1: Lorde]
Ive never seen a diamond in the flesh
I caught my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And Im not proud of my address
In a torn up town no post code envy

[Pre-Hook: Lorde]
But every songs like gold teeth, grey goose stripping in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashing the hotel room
We dont care, were driving Cadillacs in pur dreams
But everybodys like Cristal, Maybachs, diamonds on your timepeace
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We dont care, were not caught up in a love affair!

[Hook: Lorde]
And well never be royals (royals)
It dont run in our blood
That kind of luck just aint for us
We claim a different kind of buzz!
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen bee!
And baby Ill rule, Ill rule
Let me live that that fantasy!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Silver Rolls Royce, cigarette smokes scented
New fur rug, now my dirty boots in em
Flowing in the parking lot, like were rolling in the college
Mean as a dean, triple beam, well polished
She wanna watch Scandal, I wanna count a handful
Dead presidents sleeping in the attic of the mansion!
All I heard was murder, think the houses haunted
Super Bowl tickets they bitches and Fed chargers
Label the racketeer, John Gresham with a pen
Top three writer but number one at your event, ha
Mastermind unfolds like a true crime
Double M, gold mind for the whole time!

[Verse 2: Lorde]
My friends and I, weve cracked the code!](2901283)

[Verse 3: Wale]
I said, hear out, were out, bring her back, cant rewind
Back where Im from, they move shack from the line
As D-why, bricks, moving D-why, bricks
No peace sign, they peace out, they precise the shit!
Fresh up out the G5
Givenchy three times
Life is a bitch, well, my dick is a big yacht
All aboard, all aboard!
Like life is a beach, all these people they flip-flop!
When I smack the dwag shit out
Told the niggas I aint kidding, this is the Sean Kemp out
Nigga, step out, I see you niggas bitch out
Ya see these broads stand you, I get these bitches sit downs
What now? What now?
You know what? I think youre irritating
Like we didnt come out in this motherfucker through the basement
Like we aint blowing like were locals posted in Jamaica
........, a hundred cases, baby 
Now that Working Title, Purple Label, and my Jordan Laser
Everything is foreign, were of course a lot of fornication
Different cloth, nigga, ain't nothing fabricated
A lot of thoughts like a fucking scatter brain thinker
My whole pandemonium, pardon the Panamera
Its crazy, in this black and white just like an Animaniac
Uh, shout out Waco and Dot
I use your baby mother scrunchy to wrap up a nut

[Verse 4: Magazeen]
I never was a bad man, bad man
Turn on the AK turn it out!
We brought it off and we now play
Until the
You never was a man shooter, shooter
Came to the Magazeen
And yellow team  leave the scene (yellow team)
Your brother run and your mother scream
I wanna leave no witness, (witness)
Body at the wall, please! (Dead bodies)
Take shot in your face (in ya face)
Until them test me, test me
I want them where I want
Na, na, na, me gonna sing like a player!
Believe me

We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

You asked if I was feeling it, Im psycho high
Know you wont remember in the morning when
I speak my mind
Lights are on and theyve gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes, cleaning up
The champagne glasses

We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

And the terror
And the horror
When we wonder why we bother
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother
All the glamour and the trauma and the fuckin'
Melodrama

All the gun fights
And the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights
Theyll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other
Theyll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to my)
Night, midnight

[Verse 1]
Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

[Chorus]
We're King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart:
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

[Chorus]
We're King and Queen of the Weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Bridge]
Midnight, we're fading
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Us

When you get to my (midnight, lose my mind)

[Verse 1]
Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall
Everything I say falls right back into everything

[Bridge 1]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Verse 2]
Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over onstage
Hey, it's all cool
I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good
(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get it)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title
Held by everyone who's up

[Chorus]
All work and no play never made me lose it
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play keeps me on the new shit, yeah
All work and no play, let me count the bruises
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play, lonely on that new shit, yeah, yeah

[Bridge 2]
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
What does that make me?

[Bridge 1]
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet
I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

[Chorus]
All work and no play never made me lose it
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play keeps me on the new shit, yeah
All work and no play, let me count the bruises
All business, all day keeps me up a level
All work and no play, lonely on that new shit, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
In my head, I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

[Pre-Chorus]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
Ill be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

[Chorus]
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

[Verse 2]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut

[Refrain]
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
Ill be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

In my head, I do everything right
When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
Are the moments I play in the dark
And fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

[Verse 1]
Desert, middle of winter
My feet, they know America
My cheek, frozen window
My eyes eat up a handful
Gaining and then I'm leaving
Just as it starts to happen

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel the distance
But then I remember being kids
And  in the light of the disco ball
Shut my eyes, I'm still swaying in the light of the disco ball

[Verse 2]
Old part is all melting
My friend shows me everything
We run around inside our high school
The hoop in my stomach gets dunked
Over and over, think of my boys
They're in class stirring up another continent
Right now I feel the missing

[Chorus]
But then I remember being held
And swinging in the light of the disco ball
Swinging in the light of the disco ball
(Time to go)
Back there now, I'm swaying the light of the disco ball
I'm still swinging in the light of the disco ball
Back there now, I'm swaying in the light of the disco ball
(Time to go)

[Outro]
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now, be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now, would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way
Thought I would be swaying now
Thought I'd be forever in the light that way

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

I wanna use you and abuse you
I wanna know what's inside you
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on, moving on
Moving on

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused

I'm gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside
Gonna use you and abuse you
I'm gonna know what's inside you

[Intro]
Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Verse]
Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

[Chorus]
If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Intro]
Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

[Chorus]

If being strong is what you want, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

[Intro: Lorde]
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out, 15x

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Uh, yea
Living in cities with no explanations
Stuck in this place so better housing is the destination
Your living situation is the worst but that don't stop you from leaving the store with the newest purse
Money don't come easy
Shit, and friends don't either
Remember eating on the floor, almost poor and no cable but some reason got Cousin Skeeter
Living better, the family are straight
In good hands, that's All State
They play with us, to them is all games
But, to come where I'm from, it's a long way

[Hook: Lorde]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
You know who the team is
Straight to the top, yeah you know what the dream is
Came up with a scheme quick, a multimillionaire dollar one
When your back against the wall, tell me who you callin' on
The fam, the squad, the team, I mean
We was broke sharing jeans, now we on the big screen
Heartbreakers
We was the ones gettin' our hearts broke
Open up my mind it's like God spoke
He told me everything I needed to know
The young concrete rose with no water to grow
But now we in full bloom when we walk in the room
People already know what we're tryin' to do, oh

[Hook: Lorde]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Bridge: Lorde]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Hook: Lorde]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within' my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Outro: Lorde]
We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know

[Intro]
Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out
Send the call out

[Verse 1]
Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Bridge]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

[Outro]
We're on each other's team
And you know we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know and you know and you know

[Verse 1]
Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored (well I'm bored, well I'm bored, well I'm bored, well I'm bored)
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want (things I want, things I want, things I want)
And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought (things I bought, things I bought)
But I know they'll never own me

[Beat Drop]

[Interlude]
And talk it up like yeah
Yeah
And talk it up like yeah

[Bridge]
It looked alright in the pictures
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it?
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window

[Beat Drop]

[Interlude]
And talk it up like yeah
And talk it up like yeah

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon, I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known? (when I'm known, when I'm known, when)
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know they'll never own me

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown, I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

Hiya

If you are reading this, Joel & I won. HOLY CRAP

It was a crazy day & my friends and family over here are still freaking out. I just wanted to say thank you for the time you've given me these past 14 months. Finding out about me online or in between these pages or in your headphones

Without your support, there's no way I would ever have gotten to stand in the middle of the Staples Centre & perform in my school shoes

I can't wait for tonight's show. Together we'll make it magic. I'll see you there

Xxx L

[Verse 1]
Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard

[Verse 2]
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

[Pre-Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that youre doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Chorus]
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Verse 3]
Our thing progresses
I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships
To sit in hell with you
But were the greatest
Theyll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who caresstill the Louvre
Okay I know that you are not my type
(still I fall)
Im just the sucker who let you fill her mind
(but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it
Supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, youll feel it coasting

[Pre-Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that youre doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Chorus]
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Verse 1]
I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days there was enough
The card games and ease with the bitter salt of blood
I was in but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free

[Chorus]
Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

[Verse 2]
I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too ill
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne, there's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

[Chorus]
Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

[Bridge]
Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people who watched you grow up
When you're a member, go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

[Chorus]
Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

Bugs me how publications like complex will profile interesting artists in order to sell copies/get clicks and then shit on their records? it happens to me all the time- pitchfork and that ilk being like can we interview you? after totally taking the piss out of me in a review. have a stance on an artist and stick to it. dont act like you respect them then throw them under the bus
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now

[Chorus]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this

[Verse 2]
If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
Fill my dashboard just the same

[Chorus]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this
And we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning, but we got our methods
And there's nothing here to stop, to stop this

[Interlude]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

[Bridge]
I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights
In the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing, and love it

[Interlude]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

[Outro]
We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are out
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Break the newsyou're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since Ive stopped needing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 1]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, Im quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
Im done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
Were at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, theres so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Verse 2]
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
Im done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
Were at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, theres so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Outro]
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
