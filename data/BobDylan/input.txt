[Intro]
Ten thousand men on a hill
Ten thousand men on a hill
Some of m going down, some of m gonna get killed

[Verse 1]
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Drumming in the morning, in the evening theyll be coming for you

[Verse 2]
Ten thousand men on the move
Ten thousand men on the move
None of them doing nothin that your mama wouldnt disapprove

[Verse 3]
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold

[Verse 4]
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!

[Verse 5]
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me Goodnight

[Verse 6]
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Each one of m got seven wives, each one of m just out of jail

[Verse 7]
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom

[Outro]
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!
Baby, thank you for my tea!
Its so sweet of you to be so nice to me

[Intro]
One by one, they followed the sun
One by one, until there were none
Two by two, to their lovers they flew
Two by two, into the foggy dew
Three by three, they danced on the sea
Four by four, they danced on the shore
Five by five, they tried to survive
Six by six, they were playing with tricks

[Verse 1]
How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?

[Verse 2]
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven
Eight by eight, they got to the gate
Nine by nine, they drank the wine
Ten by ten, they drank it again

[Verse 3]
How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?

[Verse 4]
Two by two, they stepped into the ark
Two by two, they step in the dark
Three by three, theyre turning the key
Four by four, they turn it some more

[Outro]
One by one, they follow the sun
Two by two, to another rendezvous

[Chorus]
When I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
If she gets unruly, thinks she don't want you
If she gets unruly and thinks she don't want you
Take my 32-20 now and break her half in two
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
She got a .38 special, but I believe it's much too light
I got a 32-30, makes the camp all right

[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in Hot Springs sure ain't gonna help her none
Gonna shoot my pistol, shoot my Gatling gun
Gonna shoot my pistol, got to shoot my Gatling gun
You made me love you, now your man has come
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
Aw baby, where'd you stay last night?
You got your hair all tangled and you ain't talking right
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
Her .38 special, boys, it do very well
I got a 32-20 now it's a burning hell

[Chorus]
If I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
Send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in, sure ain't gonna help her none
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Hey hey baby, where'd you stay last night?
Didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
Oh boys, I just can't take my rest
With this 32-20 laying up and down my breast

When she said
Dont waste your words, theyre just lies
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
An' said, What else you got left?
Yeah, it was then that I got up to leave
But she said, Dont forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get

I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum I asked her "How come?"
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, Dont get cute
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum

She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out Id
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, No, dear
I said, Your words arent clear
Youd better spit out your gum
She screamed 'til her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought Id go look through her drawer

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You never wasted time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now dont ask for mine

Well Im down here on this track
Not a shirt upon my back
I will sail to you this sailing that I own
Yes, I'll feed the ?? I took
But ??
Lord, Im nine hundred miles from my home

If my own lady she says so
Ill railroad no more
Sidetrack this engine ?? to roam
Yes, Im giving it my coal
Ill gladly giving it all
Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home

If I get down by the ??
And the river still does run
Yes, and everything I see turns to foam
Even down on the ocean side
Cause he dont wait just to pay my bribe
Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home

Oh, Mary dont you moan
Dont you weep all about
Oh, Mary don't you weep and don't you moan
If I get myself in line
I will be there in due time
Cause I'm nine hundred miles from my home

Now and then there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

[Verse 2]
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And its a hard, and its a hard, its a hard, its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, and its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman who her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
Im a-going back out fore the rain starts a-falling
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioners face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And Ill tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing

[Chorus]
And its a hard, its a hard, its a hard, and its a hard
Its a hard rains a-going to fall

How many times have you heard someone say
"If I had his money, I could do things my way"
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in Ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was winning in fortune and fame;
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonesome or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

When life is over, my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

[George Harrison Cover][Verse 1]
I can see the turning of the key
Ive been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but hes vain
Oh, somethings a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

[Verse 2]
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
Hes always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin me I love ya still

[Verse 3]
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Wont you let me in your room one time fore I finally disappear?

[Verse 4]
Everybodys wearing a disguise
To hide what theyve got left behind their eyes
But me, I cant cover what I am
Wherever the children go Ill follow them

[Verse 5]
I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you Im not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Wont you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?

[Verse 6]
Ive given up the game, Ive got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure cant be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

[Verse 7]
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me its time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but youre strange

[Verse 8]
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Wont you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it
<END TEXT>
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just cant jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah, when you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately

Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright so where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I dont know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
Theyre just gonna have to wait

Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house but I cant unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man cant give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh

They were driving the women just like they drove the men

Go down old Hannah, don'cha rise no more
Don't you rise up till judgment day's for sure

Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
Its all been ground down to molasses

Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine
Well ya drove that bully till he went stone blind

Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead

As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

Ain't talking, just walking
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burning, still yearning
No one on earth would ever know

They say prayer has the power to heal, so pray for me, mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I am trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't going well

Ain't talking, just walking
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burning, still yearning
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost

Now I'm all worn down by weeping
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping
I will just slaughter 'em where they lie

Ain't talking, just walking
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking through the cities of the plague

Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down

Ain't talking, just walking
Eating hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town
Heart burning, still yearning
Some day you'll be glad to have me around

They will crush you with wealth and power
Every waking moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death and I'll step back

Ain't talking, just walking
Hand me down my walking cane
Heart burning, still yearning
Got to get you out of my miserable brain

All my loyal and my much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

Ain't talking, just walking
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
Heart burning, still yearning
Thinking about that girl I left behind

Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dying
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?

Ain't talking, just walking
Carrying a dead man's shield
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking with a toothache in my heel

The suffering is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears

Ain't talking, just walking
Walking ever since the other night
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking till I'm clean out of sight

As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone

Ain't talking, just walking
Up the road, around the bend
Heart burning, still yearning
In the last outback at the world's end

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
All rails leading to the west
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
I'm gonna throw myself upon your loving breast
It's the first new day of a grand and glorious autumn
The queen of love is coming across the grass
None may call her anything but madam
No one flirts with her nor even makes a pass
Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Standing outside the gates of wrath
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Take a little trip down the primrose path
Now I got the worst old feeling and it's getting stronger
I'm going out with a couple of fellows, I'm beginning to crack
I won't stay out any longer
I'll avenge my father's death and I'll step back
Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Hand me down my walking cane
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Trying to get you out of my miserable brain

It's all been ground down to molasses

Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old Shine
Well, ya drove that bully 'til he went stone blind

Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head
Well, you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead

Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
It's all been ground down to molasses

[Verse 1]
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl

Well, I bought me a guitar, put it in tune
Went out there the month of June
'Twas a hot dog night and a stick in a roar
Everybody was a-down on this side
There was a holy cow (holy cow)
Mean cow (mean cow)
Double jaw (double jaw)
Cow (cow)

Well, I'll tell you a story about how to become
An all American boy, you can beat on a drum
Beat on a drum from five to six
You'll be rock 'n' rollin' soon gettin' your kicks
It's a good job (good job)
Join the band (gigging in the band)
Bring your hand (pick your hand)

Clean your hand and come up tight
Roll a smoke and down at night
Hold on a train, on a whiskey jar
Settle it down there you are
Hold it steady
Pick it up now
Now hit it (makin' the girls giggle)

Yes, you'll be makin' 'em little girlies giggle
You'll be makin' 'em all just jump up an' down an' wiggle
Empty their socks, in their britches
All you'll find that soon you'll be itches
Itches all over
Itch in your pants
Itch while you dance
Itchin' on down to the corn' of France

Well, I know a boy yesterday
He become a guitar and he floated away
He played his bars and he played 'em all
He's just on there havin' a ball
Kicking a hot storm up over the ocean
He took himself a notion

He got some lotion and
He put it on his guitar, put it on him
Next time you knew you can call him Jim
Down the road, boy, they call him Slim
They don't care if they're carry him
Just a minute now, you'll see what I mean
(Uncle Sam, in this land, rippin' up draft cards, an' all that)

Well, sooner or later a man's gonna come
He gonna take a look at you, look at your drum
He'd be a man and he'll take you home
Yeah, he'll take you out to his farm
He'll give you a good one
He'll give it to ya
(Well, you meet, girls don't giggle no more)

Well, sooner or later you're bound to meet his wife
And you'll come in 'n' have the time of your life
Just pickin' the gum, pickin' up a star
Pickin' up goin' and goin' to the bar
You and your manager (pickin' my nose)

Well, you'll want to know about the manager soon
He'll just take you outside and put you on the moon
He'll buy you new clothes, new pair of shoes
You'll be walk' away with the drummer blues
You'd be a fine drummer
Pick 'em as a comer
Dog hummer

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

And when somebody needs you

If the farmer has no silo
And his fuel cost runs up high
Well, that's just how much I would love you
If you'd just only let me try

In some nice young up to date kitchen
Let us get acquainted, dear
And them old floor birds will just quit eatin'
And just grin from ear to ear

Two floor birds and a prudent baby chick
Yes that ain't, that ain't much to bust
But restriction causes damage
And damage causes lust

So poor little girl, come blow this horn
Hard as any whole night seems
It's very easily done actually
All you have to do is dream

Well, them old back scrapers are a dime a dozen
And I can get a call for a nickle
Yes, but look what an earful I get and it's all awful too
Every time I try to go get me a little tickle

So, gimme one sweet loaf of bread
Just one sweet loaf, fill it up and I'll be gone
Yes, just like some of these old floor birds
Who fly from dawn to dawn
Oh yes, who fly from dawn to dawn
Yes, who fly from dawn to dawn
Oh, fly from dawn to dawn

All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say "No, no"
All or nothing at all

All or nothing at all

[Verse 1]
Well, its always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

[Verse 2]
Blood dryin in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever it could be, makes me think youve seen me before
Angelina

[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina

[Verse 3]
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena

[Verse 4]
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

[Verse 6]
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
Ive tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina


[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
Theres a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, youre down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?

[Verse 8]
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
Hes surrounded by Gods angels and shes wearing a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

[Chorus]

[Verse 9]
I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In Gods truth tell me what you want and youll have it of course
Just step into the arena

[Verse 10]
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weeping in unholy places
Angelina

What's your hurry? Just watch this
This is one you mustn't miss:
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

A drink for me, a drink for you;
You're going to need a drink or two:
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

You never heard it sung before;
I hear it twice a month or more
Complete with tears and sheepish grins;
It only lacks the violins

The tune goes flat from time to time
The lyric sometimes fails to rhyme
But Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

It sometimes lasts the whole night long
Depends on how long she's been gone
I sit and look as hard as nails;
She knows the damn thing never fails

Take the bottle, fill your cup;
Don't miss the part where I fold up;
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

It isn't Annie's only tune;
The other I'll be hearing soon
Next week, tomorrow, or today;
She sings it when she goes away

Take the bottle, fill your cup;
Don't miss the part where I fold up;
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again;
Come on, Annie, sing you song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

[Verse 1]
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day being pleasant and charming

[Verse 2]
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant he cried
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply
Intending no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning

[Verse 3]
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning."

[Verse 4]
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning
And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Although that your offers are charming

[Verse 5]
"And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning,"
"Oh no," says the Sergeant. "I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning."

[Verse 6]
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
"Now take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride
"And temper their edge in the morning!"

[Verse 7]
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning

[Verse 8]
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning'

[Verse 9]
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide

[Verse 1]
As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paines
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains
I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm

[Verse 2]
Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
Said she, But I dont wish to
Said I, But you have no choice
I beg you, sir, she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together well fly south

[Verse 3]
Just then Tom Paine, himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
Im sorry, sir, he said to me
Im sorry for what shes done

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold

I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold

Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song

But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall

The bells are golden chimes
The sun is going to shine

We're gonna cook some lovin'
It's a-gonna sizzle and fry

[Intro]
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge
Ric is a blues guitar player. I met him one day in
The green pastures of the Harvard University

[Chorus]
Baby let me follow you down
Baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

[Verse 1]
Can I come home with you
Baby can I come home with you?
Yes I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me come home with you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yes I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

[Additional Verses (1966 live version)]
I'll buy you a diamond ring
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

I'll buy you rope and twine
Honey, just for you to climb
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just once drive me out of my mind

Buy you a hoop and skirt
I'll buy you a velvet shirt
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just don't make me hurt

Paroles de la chanson Backwater Blues :
It rained five days
The sky has turned black as night
Oh, it rained five days
And the sky has turned black as night
And there's trouble takin' place
Way down in the lowlands tonight

I woke up this mornin'
And I couldn't get out of my front door
I woke up this mornin'
And I couldn't get out of my front door
It was so much trouble
Make a poor man wonder where he wanna go

They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
They rowed a little boat
About five miles 'cross the pond
I packed up all of my things and threw 'em in
Boys and the boat rowed along

I climbed up on the high lonely hill
Oh, I climbed up on the high oh, lonely hill
And I looked down at the house
Baby, where I used to live

Backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go
The backwater blues caused me
To pack my things and go
'Cause my house fell down
And I can't live there no more

Yeah, when it's thunderin' and lightnin'
And the rain begin to pour
When it's thunderin' and lightnin'
And the wind begin to blow
There are so many poor people
That didn't have no place to go

[Verse 1]
Sad Im a-sittin on the railroad track
Watching that old smokestack
Train is a-leavin but it wont be back

[Verse 2]
Years ago we hang around
Watching trains roll through the town
Now that train is a-graveyard bound

[Verse 3]
Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he

[Verse 4]
Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away

[Verse 5]
A diesel truck was headin down
Carryin' up a heavy load
Left him on a Utah road

[Verse 6]
They carried him back to his hometown
His mother cried, his sister moaned
Listening to them church bells tone

[Verse 7]
A diesel truck was rollin' slow
Pullin' down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road

[Verse 1]
I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken

[Verse 2]
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us

[Verse 3]
Of the two sisters, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her

[Verse 4]
For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society

[Verse 5]
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime

[Verse 6]
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To the sin of love's false security

[Verse 7]
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?

[Verse 8]
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces

[Verse 9]
"The tragic figure" her sister did shout
"Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness

[Verse 10]
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows

[Verse 11]
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me

[Verse 12]
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is

[Verse 13]
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
"How good, how good does it feel to be free?"
And I answer them most mysteriously
"Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"

[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

[Refrain]
Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you ask "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say "What's mine?"
And somebody else says "Well, what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"

[Refrain]
But something is happening
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 3]
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says "How does it feel to
Be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone

[Refrain]
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 4]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known

[Refrain]
But something is happening here
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 5]
Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"

[Refrain]
And you know something is happening
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?

[Verse 6]
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "Now"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back "You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home"

[Refrain]
And you know something's happening
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?

[Verse 7]
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

[Refrain]
'Cause something is happening
And ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mr. Jones?

My name is Donald White, you see
I stand before you all
I was judged by you a murderer
And the hangman's knot must fall
I will die upon the gallows pole
When the moon is shining clear
And these are my final words
That you will ever hear

I left my home in Kansas
When I was very young
I landed in the old Northwest
Seattle, Washington
Although I'd a-traveled many miles
I never made a friend
For I could never get along in life
With people that I met

If I had some education
To give me a decent start
I might have been a doctor or
A master in the arts
But I used my hands for stealing
When I was very young
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells
That's how my life begun

Oh, the inmates and the prisoners
I found they were my kind
And it was there inside the bars
I found my peace of mind
But the jails they were too crowded
Institutions overflowed
So they turned me loose to walk upon
Life's hurried tangled road

And there's danger on the ocean
Where the salt sea waves split high
And there's danger on the battlefield
Where the shells of bullets fly
And there's danger in this open world
Where men strive to be free
And for me the greatest danger
Was in society

So I asked them to send me back
To the institution home
But they said they were too crowded
For me they had no room
I got down on my knees and begged
"Oh, please put me away,"
But they would not listen to my plea
Or nothing I would say

And so it was on Christmas eve
In the year of '59
It was on that night I killed a man
I did not try to hide
The jury found me guilty
And I won't disagree
For I knew that it would happen
If I wasn't put away

And I'm glad I've had no parents
To care for me or cry
For now they will never know
The horrible death I die
And I'm also glad I've had no friends
To see me in disgrace
For they'll never see that hangman's hood
Wrap around my face

Farewell unto the old north woods
Of which I used to roam
Farewell unto the crowded bars
Of which've been my home
Farewell to all you people
Who think the worst of me
I guess you'll feel much better when
I'm on that hanging tree

But there's just one question
Before they kill me dead
I'm wondering just how much
To you I really said
Concerning all the boys that come
Down a road like me
Are they enemies or victims
Of your society?

He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down

He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
He looked for work and money
And ya' walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they dont know how to smile

Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre a-tugging at your sleeve
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre a-tugging at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If theres anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell ya'
That you aint a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder now
Its a-poundin' on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
Its a-poundin' on your brain
Your wifes screams are stabbin' ya'
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass is turnin' black
Theres no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
Theres no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
Thats hanging on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That youre holding in your hand

Theres seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Theres seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the oceans poundin' roar

Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewheres in the distance
Theres seven new people born

Tenderly william kissed his wife
Then he opened her head with a butcher knife
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
Lady margaret's pillow was wet with tears
Nobody's been on it for 20 years
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by
Little billy brown will shake with fright
He's got a new daddy and mommy every night
And the swan on the river goes gliding by
The swan on the river goes gliding by

"a 20 pound baby without any head"
And the swan on the river went lookin'.....

Down these streets the fools rule
There's no freedom or self respect
A knife's point or a trip to the joint
Is about all you can expect

They kill people here who stand up for their rights
The system's just too damned corrupt
It's always the same, the name of the game
Is who do you know higher up

Wealth is a filthy rag
So erotic so unpatriotic
So wrapped up in the American flag

Witchcraft scum exploiting the dumb
Turning children into punks and slaves
Whose heroes and healers are rich dope dealers
Who should be put in their graves
Tell the truth now..

This might be your last night in a bed so soft
We're not pimps on the make, politicians on the take

We're gonna blow up your home of Voodoo
And watch it burn without any regret
We got the power we're the new government
You just don't know it yet
Help me now..

Ah, bring it to me honey

For all of my brothers from Vietnam
And my uncles from World War II
I'd like to say that it's countdown time now
And we're gonna do what the law should do

And for you pretty baby
I know you've seen it all
I know your story is too painful to share
One day though you'll be talking in your sleep
And when you do, I wanna be there
Yeah..

Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar

One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known

I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle

I humbled myself to her beauty
"Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"

"Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure

Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"

"Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfil our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise

I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"

Oh what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future?
Say the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner?
Say the black bells of Rhondda
And who robbed the miner?
Say the big bells of Blaina

They will plunder willy-nilly
Say the bells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth
Shout the loud bells of Neath
Even God is uneasy
Say the moist bells of Swansea
And what will you give me?
Say the bad bells of Rhymney

Throw the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport
All would be well, if, if, if, if
Say the green bells of Cardiff
Why so worried, sister, why?

Bessie was more than just a friend of mine
We shared the good times with the bad
Now many a year has passed me by
I still recall the best thing I ever had

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm wonderin' what she'll do

Now all the crazy things I had to try
Well I tried them all and then some
But if you're lucky one day you find out
Where it is you're really comin' from

I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
When I get there I'm wonderin' what she'll do

Now in my day I've made some foolish moves
But back then, I didn't worry 'bout a thing
Now and again I still wonder to myself
Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing

'Cause now I'm goin' down the road t' see Bessie
Oh, see her soon
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith
And when I get there I'm wonderin' what she'll do

Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby
For as long as love will last

Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me, pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head

Nothin done, and nothin said

Beyond the horizon, behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love

[Verse 1]
My wretched heart's pounding
I felt an angel's kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss

Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever for one and for all

[Verse 2]
Beyond the horizon across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul

[Verse 3]
I'm touched with desire
What don't I do?
I'll throw the logs on the fire
I'll build my world around you

Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same

[Verse 4]
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time

[Verse 5]
It's dark and it's dreary
I ponder in vain
I'm weakened, I'm weary
My repentance is plain

Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me

[Verse 6]
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone


[Verse 7]
It's late in the season
Never knew, never cared
Whatever the reason
Someone's life has been spared

[Outro]
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Well I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
But the tears that I shed for that woman are gonna flood you Big River
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die

They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hotspot
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Late last night I heard my screen door slam
A big yellow bulldozer took away the house and land
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?

This is the story of Hezekiah Jones
Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas
He never had too much, except he had some land
An' he had a couple of hogs and things like that
He never had much money
But he'd spend what he did make as fast as he made it
So it never really mattered that he had much money
But in a cupboard there, he kept in the cupboard...
He kept in the cupboard books
He called the books his "rainy season."
The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...
They... said, "Well... old Hezekiah, he's harmless enough
But the way I see it he better put down them goddam books
Readin' ain't no good, for nigga is nigga."
One day the white man's preacher came around
Knockin' on doors, knockin' on all the doors in the county
He knocked on Hezekiah's door
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?"
Hezekiah says, "Well, I don't know, I never really SEEN the Lord
I can't say, yes, I do..."
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?"
Hezekiah says, "Well, the Church is divided, ain't they
And... they can't make up their minds
I'm just like them, I can't make up mine either."
He says, "Hezekiah, you believe that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?"
Hezekiah says, "I'm good... good as my neighbor."
"You don't believe in nothin'," said the white man's preacher
You don't believe in nothin'!"
"Oh yes, I do," says Hezekiah
"I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbors
Not for the reward of a Heaven or fear of hellfire."
"But you don't understand," said the white man's preacher
"There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked..."
Then they hung Hezekiah high as a pigeon
White folks around there said, "Well... he had it comin'
'Cause the son-of-a-bitch never had no religion!"

[Verse 1]
I woke in the mornin', wandering
Weary and worn out
I woke in the morning, wandering
Weary and worn out
Wishin my long-lost lover
Would walk to me, and talk to me
Tell me what its all about

[Verse 2]
I was standin at the side road
Listenin to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road
Listenin to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin
Tickin like a clock

[Verse 3]
Well I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time, day time
Any time you want

[Verse 4]
Sometimes Im thinkin' Im
Too high to fall
Sometimes Im thinkin' Im
Much too high to fall
Other times Im thinkin' Im
So low I dont know
If I can come up at all

[Verse 5]
Black crows in the meadow
Sleepin' across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though its funny, honey
I'm outta' touch, dont feel much like a
Scarecrow today

[Verse 1]
Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 2]
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
Pardon, monsieur, the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
Am I hearing you right?
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking hes the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 3]
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
Can you see anything?
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says, Open up another deck
But the dealer says, Attendez-vous, sil vous plait
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 4]
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the womans hand
Said, Heres a ring, it cost a grand
She said, That is not enough
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, Do Not Disturb
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 5]
Ive got to talk to someone quick!
But the Greek said, Go away, and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, Help, theres danger near
Please open up the door!
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said, It happens every day
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 6]
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said, Its too late now
You can take your money, but I dont know how
Youll spend it in the tomb
The tiny man bit the soldiers ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While shes out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her
My darling, je vous aime beaucoup
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 7]
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A
Watching old Cronkite on the seven oclock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didnt seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
Theres another hard-luck story that youre going to hear
And theres really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 1]
Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back
A-whistling loud and merry
Made the woods around him ring
And he charmed the heart of a lady
Charmed the heart of a lady

[Verse 2]
"How old are you, my pretty little miss
How old are you, my honey"
She answered to him with a lovin' smile
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday
Be sixteen come Sunday."

[Verse 3]
"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss
Come and go with me, my honey
Take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money
You never will want for money

[Chorus]
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
All made of Spanish leather
Get behind me on my horse
And we'll ride off together
We'll both go off together."

Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together
They rode off together

[Verse 4]
At night the boss came home
Inquiring about this lady
The servant spoke before she thought
"She's been with Black Jack Dave
Rode off with Black Jack Davey."

[Verse 5]
"Well, saddle for me my coal black stud
He's speedier than the gray
I rode all day and I'll ride all night
And I'll overtake my lady
I'll bring back my lady."

[Verse 6]
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight
Till he came to a river raging
And there he spied his darling bride
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
"Would you forsake your house and home
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your husband, too
To go with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey?"

[Verse 8]
"Well, I'll forsake my house and home
And I'll forsake my baby
I'll forsake my husband, too
For the love of Black Jack Davey
Ride off with Black Jack Davey."

[Verse 9]
"Last night I slept in a feather bed
Between my husband and baby
Tonight I lay on the river banks
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Love my Black Jack Davey."

Seen the arrow on the door post
Saying, "This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem"
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes moaning
Hear the undertaker's bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well, God is in Heaven
And we all want what's His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is

How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 2]
Yes, how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 3]
Yes, How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart

I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab I have you understand
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale
We're going over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail
Haul on the bowline," we sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea

"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads"
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons

Ah, me, I busted out, don't even ask me how
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around, saying, "Ban the bums"
I jumped right into line saying, "I hope that I'm not late"
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight

I went into a restaurant, lookin' for the cook
I told them I was the editor of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat
Food was flying everywhere, I left without my hat

Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral, and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again

Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way"
The man says, "Get out of here, I'll tear you limb from limb"
I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too." He said, "You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop"
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop

I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door, this Englishman said, "Fab"
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor, and the man asked me who I was

I repeated that my friends were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die"
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line

Well, by this time I was fed up at tryin' to make a stab
At bringin' back any help for my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship

Well, I got back and took the parkin' ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past
They asked me my name and I said, "Captain Kidd"
They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid

Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships a-sailin', they were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus. I just said, "Good luck"
<END TEXT>
I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, "Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline"
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they're far away at sea

"I think I'll call it America"
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, "Let's set up a fort
And start buyin' a place with beads"
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail
For carrying harpoons

Ah, me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Sayin', "Ban the bums"
I jumped right into line
Sayin' "I hope that I'm not late"
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight

I went into a restaurant
Looking for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some Suzette, I said
"Could you please make that Crepe?"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flyin' everywhere
I left without my hat

Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley

[Verse 1]
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybodys troubles
Everybodys except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine

[Verse 2]
Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal Im loving
And Lord Ill love her till Im dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

[Verse 3]
Lord, I am not going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I dont have no sports car
And I dont even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block

[Verse 4]
Well, the wind keeps a-blowing me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you dont step on me

[Verse 5]
Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!

Unlike most of the songs nowadays that are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley
That's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays
This, this is a song, this wasn't written up there
This was written somewhere down in the United States

Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were ridin' down the line
Fixin' everybody's troubles, everybody's 'cept mine
Someone must've told em that I was doin' fine

Oh, you five and ten cent women there's nothin' in your heads
I got a real gal I'm in love with, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead
Go away from my door and my window too right now

Lord, I ain't goin' down to no racetrack to see no sports car run
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block

Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me up and down the street
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don't step on me, on me

Well, look it here, buddy, you want to be like me
Pull your your six-shooter and rob every bank you see
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
While riding on a train going west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

[Verse 2]
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn

[Verse 3]
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words was told, our songs was sung
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied
Jokin and talkin about the world outside

[Verse 4]
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold
We never much thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
And our chances really was a million to one

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 5]
As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices, they were few and the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split

[Verse 6]
How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one Ive never seen again

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 7]
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
Id give it all gladly if our lives could be like that

I was sittin' on a stump down in New Orleans
I was feelin' kinda low down, dirty an' mean
Along come a fella and he didn't even ask
He said, "I know of a woman who can fix you up fast."

Well I didn't think twice, I just said like I should
"Let's go find this lady who can do me some good."
We walked across Rampart on a sailin' spree
And we come to a door called one-oh-three

I's just about ready to give my little knock
When out comes a fella who couldn't even walk
He's linkin' and a-slinkin', couldn't stand on his feet
And he moaned and he groaned and he shuffled down the street

Well, out of the door there comes another man
He couldn't even talk and he couldn't even stand
He moaned and he groaned and he shuffled his feet
And he slid slidin' backwards down on Rampart street

Well, I peeked thru the key hole and comin' down the hall
Was a long legged man who could hardly crawl
He had a terrible mean look in his eye
Like he'd just fall to burn, he's was ready to die

Well somebody else with his hell of a miss
Fell out of the window and he fell the test
Well he slid and he slunk in broken french
And he looked like he'd been thru a monkey wrench

Well, by this time I was a-scared to knock
I was a-scared to move, I's in a state of shock
I hummed a little tune and I shuffled my feet
And I started walkin' backwards down Rampart street

Well, I got to the corner I tried my best smile
I turned around the corner and I ran a bloody mile
Man, I wasn't around for to meet my wife
I's just a-runnin' for to save my life

Well, I's coughin' in my ears and wheezin' in my chest
I musta run a mile in a minute or less
I tripped on a log and I flumped on a stump
I caught a fast freight train with a one-arm jump

So if you're travellin' down Louisiana way
And you're feelin' kinda lonesome and you need a place to stay
Man, you're better off in your misery
Than to tackle that lady in one-oh-three

Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
She was a-fishin' on a leading chain
And me an' John, oh was a long catch on
It was the last of the ones I've seen

So with a sword and a rope in belt
Feel all that your heart be sailed
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge
It was a-more than feelin' bad
And with all kind friends we watched in fear
It was a naught time we ever had

So it's rise up my lads
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

And all day long at Vera Cruz
We sailed [all the likes] to bind
With no heavy moan, any hearts of stone
No aid was tried for mine

So it's cheer up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

Well, now along cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
All along cape Horn
And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead
It was all in the time of storm

So, it's cheer on up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Fishin' for the whales

She wears loafer shoes, a dungaree
Red jacket shirt if you please
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

Now she digs that music with a beat
Rock 'n' rollin' is her need
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

On Saturday night she comes to town
She plays the jukebox, let her hair hung down
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl
Let 'em roll..

She digs some cherries, she can milk a cow
Don't like squares, though daddy taught her how
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

She's up every mornin' about half past five
She likes to go fishin' 'cause it keeps you alive
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

Now when she's dancin' the kids hang around
They dig my baby 'cause she really goes to town
My boogie woogie, boogie woogie, boogie woogie country girl
Well I mean what I mean, my boogie woogie country girl

Yeah, man..

Oh, Im sailin' away my own true love
Im a-sailin' away in the morning
Is there somethin' I can send you from across the sea
From the place that Ill be landing?

No, theres nothin' you can send me, my own true love
Theres nothin' Im'a wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

Well, if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
Id forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For thats all Im a-wishin' to be ownin'

Well I might be gone a long old time
And its only that Im asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I want again tomorrow

I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I dont know when Ill be comin' back again
It depends on how Im a-feelin'

If a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
Im sure your mind is a-roamin'
Im sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where youre goin'

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, theres somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather

[Verse 1]
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
Youre coming thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams

[Verse 2]
Youre blowing down the shaky street
Youre hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
Where we were born in time

[Verse 3]
Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
Its revealing

[Verse 4]
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling

[Verse 5]
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You wont get anything you dont deserve
Where we were born in time

[Verse 6]
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, youll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire

[Verse 7]
Is still smoking
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken

[Verse 8]
In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have whats left of me
Where we were born in time

One, two, a-one two three

In the lonely night
In the shadows of a pale moonlight
I think of you in black and white
When we were made of dreams
I walk alone through the shakin' street
I'm a-listenin' to my heart beat
In the record breaking heat
Where we were born in time

Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time, i'll have no more of this
It's much too cruel, it's much too cool, way too revealing
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
Oh babe, how you left me reelin' with this feelin'
Up on the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
I held you close and got what i deserve
Where we were born in time

You pressed me once, pressed me twice
You hang the flame, but you'll pay the price
Oh babe, and that fire is still smokin'
You were snow, you were rain

Just when I was ready to receive ya
You were smooth, you were rough
You were more than enough
Oh babe, why did I ever leave ya?
Or grieve ya?
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
I took you close and got what I deserve
When we were born in time
Just when I knew who to thank, you went blank
Just when the firelight was gleaming
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain

Or was I dreaming?

Hold that down, you better keep it neat
For when it's over, it was incomplete
Oh, I took it down and said, oh, oh have a seat
But I don't live down on Bourbon Street
No more, no more, no more, no more
No, I don't live on Bourbon Street no more

Bourbon Street lordy-town

Put all your loving apples on your feet
But I don't even mind if you want to scratch your feet
You can bag it down in butter, butter sweet
Now don't (??) on my Bourbon Street

Wastin' all your time just braggin'
When ya' should be busy
Plowin' and a'plantin'
You stand there a'rantin'
Get no harvest (?) your heart

Braggin'
You ain't got no cause for braggin'
When your barn needs mendin'
And your lawn needs mowin'
How come you're a crowin'
Like a no-good rooster at dawn

Braggin' 'bout your fishin'
'Bout your horseshoe pitchin'
Bet you always keep the score
Talkin' 'bout your meddle
That's the kind they peddle
Down at the 5 and 10 store

Braggin'
Folks ain't got no use for braggin'
If your fields are greener
Folks will hear about it
You don't hafta shout it
Fields were greener 'fore you were born

Sylvie is a good old girl, from Florida so they say
She came up here last April to pass some time away

Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

Sylvie came here Wednesday
She came this morning by the light of the dawn
She comes up here now nearly all of the time
To see if she can carry on

Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

Sylvie says she loves me
She says it all of the time
She always gets behind me
When the hill is too high to climb

Now bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

She brings beer and honey
Brings me slop and beans
Brings me coconuts and candy
Brings me turnip greens

Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow
For my tired brow
Oh, for my tired brow

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels

Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke

Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door

Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
Now you hear me tappin', tappin' across your floor

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell

Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death

Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off

Well, we're drivin' this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore to remember the times when I was your only man
And she don't want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love

Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin' lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said, "Henry ain't here but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of bummin' a ride back to where she started
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead." You could tell she was so broken-hearted
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."

"How far are y'all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh
"We're going all the way 'til the wheels fall off and burn
'Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."

Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my head
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be lookin' my way

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love

Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossin' the street when shots rang out
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran
"We got him cornered in the churchyard," I heard somebody shout

Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it, it said, "A man with no alibi."
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do

Now I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much. I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how

Well, I'm standin' in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about
But I'll see him in anything so I'll stand in line

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love

You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't Henry Porter
And you know there was somethin' about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I left behind in the French Quarter

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone
You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's most convenient, then they repent
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."

There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun and he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls, teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world, Brownsville girl, you're my honey love

[Verse 1]
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

[Verse 2]
Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what its like to every moment face his death

[Verse 3]
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I cant believe weve lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train

[Verse 4]
I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

[Verse 5]
Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didnt feel like letting my head get blown off

[Verse 6]
Well, were driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies
Now I know she aint you but shes here and shes got that dark rhythm in her soul
But Im too over the edge and I aint in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she dont want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control

Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love
Honey baby, I can stand

I been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me
Honey babby, Ill be here

[Verse 3]
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery

[Verse 4]
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I aint no monkey, but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
Im taking you with me
Honey baby, when I go

[Verse 5]
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do, and you do it well
Ill do it for you
Honey baby, cant you tell?

Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful

And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know

Bye and bye, Im breathin a lovers sigh
Im sittin on my watch so I can be on time
Im singin loves praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you Im casting my eye

Im paintin the townswinging my partner around
I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
Im watchin the roads, Im studying the dust
Im paintin the town making my last go-round

Well, Im scufflin and Im shufflin and Im walkin on briars
Im not even acquainted with my own desires

Im rollin slowIm doing all I know
Im tellin myself I found true happiness
That Ive still got a dream that hasnt been repossessed
Im rollin slow, goin where the wild roses grow

Well the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last

Papa gone mad, mamma, shes feeling sad
Im gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
Im gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be

Without a shadow of doubt
I knew it this morning
Without a shadow of doubt
My suitcase is packed
My clothes are hangin' out

San Francisco is fine
You sure get lots of sun

Honey, you just went away
Well, children cry for mother
I tell them, "Mother took a trip"
Well, children cry for mother

Well, I walk on pins and needles
I hope my tongue don't slip
Well, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
But the sun goes around the heavens
And another day just drives on through
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
But that's alright, baby
You know I always understand
Call girls in the doorway
All giving me the eye
Call girls in the doorway
All giving me the eye
But my heart's just not in it
I might as well pass right on by
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
Well, it can't be no guitar player
It must be convent bells

He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

[Verse 1]
Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl
She's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy
It's true she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him
Like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o

[Verse 2]
So she bargained with the sailor boy
All for a piece of gold
Straightaway then he led her
Down into the hold
Sayin', "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
Your jacket shall be blue
You'll see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o

[Verse 3]
Now, when the other sailors heard the news
Well, they fell into a rage
And with all the ship's company
They were willing to engage
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys
Overboard we'll throw her
She'll never see that seaport town
Called Canadee-i-o

[Verse 4]
Now, when the captain he heard the news
Well, he too fell in a rage
And with the whole ship's company
He was willing to engage
Sayin', "She'll stay in sailor's clothes
Her color shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town
Call Canadee-i-o

[Verse 5]
Now, when they come down to Canada
Scarcely 'bout half a year
She's married this bold captain
Who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now
She cuts a gallant show
Finest of the ladies
Down Canadee-i-o

[Verse 6]
Come, all you fair and tender girls
Wheresoever you may be
I'd have you to follow your own true love
Whene'er he goes to sea
For if the sailors prove false to you
Well, the captain, he might prove true
You'll see the honor I have gained
By the wearing of the blue

Oh the evening train is rolling
All along the homeward way
All my hopes are over the horizon
All my dreams have gone away
The hillside darkly shaded
Stars fall from above
All the joys of Earth have faded
The night's untouched, my love
I'll be here 'til tomorrow
Beneath a shroud of gray
I pretend I'm free of sorrow
My heart is miles away
The dead bells are ringing
My train is overdue
To your memory I'm clinging
I can't escape from you

Well I hear the sound of thunder
Roaring loud and long
Sometimes you've got to wonder
God knows I've done no wrong
You've wasted all your power
You threw out the Christmas pie
Now you're withering like a flower
You'll play the fool and die
I'm neither sad nor sorry
I'm all dressed up in black
I fought for fame and glory
You tried to break my back
In the far off sweet forever
The sunshine peeking through
We should have walked together
I can't escape from you

I cannot grasp the shadows
That gather near the door
Rain falls round my window
I wish I'd seen you more
The path is ever winding
The stars they never age
The morning light is blinding
All the world's a stage
Should be the time of gladness
Happy faces everywhere
The mystery of madness
Is propagating in the air
I don't like the city
Not like some folks do
Isn't it a pity
I can't escape from you

We plowed the fields of heaven
Right down to the end
I hope I can be forgiven
If any words of mine offend
All our days were splendid
They were simple, they were plain
It never should have ended
I should have kissed you in the rain
I've been thinking things all over
All the moments full of grace
The primrose and the clover
Your ever changing face
Can't help looking at you
You made love with god-knows-who
Never found a gal to match you
I can't escape from you

Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you ?

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Where she leads me I do not know
Well, she leads me where she goes
I can't find her nowhere
Well, she needs me here
All aware I can't hear her walk
I just cannot hear her talk
Though sometimes, you know you will
And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say
That I don't wanna try
I tried, also cried
But I can't leave her behind

I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind
I can't wait, waitin' just makin' me go blind
Do you ever lay awake at night your face turned to the wall
Drownin' in your thoughtlessness and cut off from it all
I don't know, maybe to you it's not that late
But as for me don't know how much longer I can wait

It's got to end, everything about it just feels wrong
I pretend, being close to her is where I don't belong
Well my back is to the sun because the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
I'll stay here where I can feel the hand of fate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, life is short and I think of her a lot
I can't say if I want the pain to end or not
Well the blindness overtakin' me is beatin' like a drum
I don't know where it starts or where it's coming from
How it is, we'll all try to concentrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I been drinkin'
Drinkin' forbidden juices
I been livin'
Livin' on lame excuses

My hands are cold, the end of time has just begun
I'm getting old, anything can happen now to anyone
I walk across the floor 'til I wear out my shoes
You think you've lost it all there's always more to lose
I'm so clear, she can keep my head on straight

I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don't know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore; I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don't know what I might do
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true
That's how it is when things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait

I'm doomed to love you
I've been rolling through stormy weather
I'm thinking of you
And all the places we could roam together

It's mighty funny; the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate

[Verse 1]
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously

[Verse 2]
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far
Were we sniper bait? Did we follow a star?
To a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech

[Verse 3]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire

[Verse 4]
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know hes got our best interest in mind
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind

[Verse 5]
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken, theres a heat in my bed
Street band playing Nearer My God to Thee
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said, I know what youre thinking, but there aint a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree

[Verse 6]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire

[Verse 7]
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, Daddy, I always think its for me
But its only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls

[Verse 8]
Would I have married her? I dont know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond

[Verse 9]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire

[Verse 1]
Lazy stadium night
Catfish on the mound
Strike three, the umpire said
Batter have to go back and sit down

[Chorus]
Catfish, million-dollar-man
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can

[Verse 2]
Used to work on Mr. Finleys farm
But the old man wouldnt pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come up where the Yankees are
Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custom-made cigar
Wear an alligator boot

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Carolina born and bred
Love to hunt the little quail
Got a hundred-acre spread
Got some huntin dogs for sale

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Reggie Jackson at the plate
Seeing nothing but the curve
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve

[Chorus]

[6Verse ]
Even Billy Martin grins
When the Fish is in the game
Every season twenty wins
Gonna make the Hall of Fame

[Chorus]

[Intro]
The cats in the well, the wolf is looking down
The cats in the well, the wolf is looking down
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground

[Verse 1]
The cats in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Cats in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
She aint hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin her deep

The cats in the well and grief is showing its face
The worlds being slaughtered and its such a bloody disgrace

[Verse 2]
The cats in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
The cats in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump

The cats in the well, and Papa is reading the news
His hairs falling out and all of his daughters need shoes

[Verse 3]
The cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
The night is so long and the table is oh, so full

The cats in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war

[Outro]
The cats in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
The cats in the well, leaves are starting to fall
Goodnight, my love, may the Lord have mercy on us all

Sixteen years
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves
Fortune calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On midsummer's eve, near the tower
The cold-blooded moon
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
They shaved her head
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
I stumbled to my feet
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you
The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times
She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks
Gentlemen, he said
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning, either getting ready for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
Peace will come
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords

[Verse 1]
Far between sundowns finish and midnights broken toll
We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 2]
Through the citys melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 3]
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked it's poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 4]
And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 5]
Even though a clouds white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 6]
Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

[Verse 1]
Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
I know the place to go

[Verse 2]
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?

[Verse 3]
How'd you like to stay up late, like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true

[Verse 4]
How'd you like to stay up late like the islanders do?

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know why he couldnt adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
Thats what they did

[Verse 2]
They said whats up is down, they said what isnt is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
They said, Listen boy, youre just a pup
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up

They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill

They said Congratulations, you got what it takes
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette

He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed

He went to Hollywood to see Peter OToole
He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
He couldve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Couldve been an accountant or a tennis star

He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay

His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They got to sleep together in a home they dont own

[Chorus]

[Verse 8]
Well, everybodys asking why he couldnt adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust

They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about

He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
After a while we took in the clothes
Nobody said very much
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
Which nobody really wanted to touch
Mama come in and picked up a book
And Papa asked her what it was
Someone else asked, What do you care?
Papa said, Well, just because
Then they started to take back their clothes
Hang them on the line
It was January the thirtieth
And everybody was feelin fine

[Verse 2]
The next day everybody got up
Seeing if the clothes were dry
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed
Mama, of course, she said, Hi!
Have you heard the news? he said, with a grin
The Vice-Presidents gone mad!
Where? Downtown. When? Last night
Hmm, say, thats too bad!
Well, theres nothing we can do about it, said the neighbor
Its just something were gonna have to forget
Yes, I guess so, said Ma
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet

[Verse 3]
I reached up, touched my shirt
And the neighbor said, Are those clothes yours?
I said, Some of them, not all of them
He said, Ya always help out around here with the chores?
I said, Sometime, not all the time
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as Papa yelled outside
Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes
Well, I just do what Im told
So, I did it, of course
I went back in the house and Mama met me

Well, Im all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die

Im waist deep, waist deep in the mist
Its almost like, almost like I dont exist
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 2]
The walls of pride are high and wide
Cant see over to the other side
Its such a sad thing to see beauty decay
Its sadder still to feel your heart torn away

One look at you and Im out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Theres too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of m were friends of mine, I was wrong about m all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillsides mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood

I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasnt proved true
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill

Its you and you only I been thinking about
But you cant see in and its hard lookin out
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 5]
Well the fats in the fire and the waters in the tank
The whiskeys in the jar and the moneys in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
Im gonna remember forever the joy that we shared

Looking at you and Im on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

I'm gonna remember forever the joy that we shared

Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
I'm twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Be careful how you court young men
They're like a star on a summer's morning
They'll first appear and then they're gone

They'll tell you some loving story
They'll declare to you their love is true
Then they will go and court some other
And that's the love they have for you

Do you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe with falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the West

I wish I was a little sparrow
And I had wings with which to fly
Right over to see my false true-lover
And when he's talking I'd be nigh

But I'm not a little sparrow
I have no wings with which to fly
So I sit here in grief and sorrow
To weep and pass my troubles by

If I had known before I courted
That love was such a killing thing
I'd a-locked my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it up with a silver pin
<END TEXT>
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gon' be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't that be fine?

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
<END TEXT>
By Bob Dylan and Helena Springs

We have got to come together
How long can we stay apart?
You may get it maybe never
But it's coming from the heart

Your life is full of indecision
You can't make up your mind
We must get it in position
And move it on down the line

'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind

Make me up a bed of roses
And hang them down from the vine
Of all my loves you've been the closest
That's ever been on my mind

Please don't talk about tomorrow
I'm really not one to care
This world is filled with too much sorrow
That nobody's heart should bear

'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind

Please, please give me indication
Stop and talk to me
Like a river that is flowing
My love will never cease to be

You will always be my honey
No one could take your part
Our love can't be bought with money
'Cause it's coming from the heart

'Cause the road is long, it's a long hard climb
I been on that road too long of a time
Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds
When I think of the love that I left behind

Confidential as a baby's kiss
Smooth like a baby's breath
Your love for me will always be
Confidential to me

Oh, to look...

..and Im a fool
Each stars a pool of water, cool clear water
But with the dawn Ill wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool, clear water.
And way up there Hell hear our prayer
And show us where theres water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin, Dan, dont you listen to him, Dan
Hes a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can you see that big green tree
Where the waters running free
And its waiting there for you and me
Cool, clear water

Dans feet are sore, hes yearning for
Just one thing more than water
Cool, clear water
Like me, I guess, hed like to rest
Where theres no quest for water
Cool, clear water

[Verse 1]
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight

[Verse 2]
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight

[Verse 3]
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792

Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Way up yonder, great will be her reward
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star
I know I can trust you to stay where you are

[Chorus]
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be

[Verse 2]
Ive been broken, shattered like an empty cup
Im just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it cause Hes faithful and Hes true
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you

Covenant woman, intimate little girl
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world
You know we are strangers in a land were passing through
Ill always be right by your side, Ive got a covenant too

Crash on the levee, mama
Water's going to overflow
Swamp's going to rise
No boat's going to row
Now, you can train on down
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint

[Chorus]
But oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try an' move me
You're just going to lose
There's a crash on the levee

If you go down in the flood
It's going to be your own fault

I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
Somethin' came up out of the sea
Swept through the land of the rich and the free

I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet

Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide
The foe has crossed over from the other side
They tip their caps from the top of the hill
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill

Along the dim Atlantic line
The ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avengin' God

The world is old, the world is gray
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand
To the music that comes from a far better land

Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend
Killed outright he was, by his own men

It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year
I feel that the unknown world is so near
Pride will vanish and glory will rot
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot

The bells of the evening have rung
There's blasphemy on every tongue
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal to truth and to right

Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood

Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost

A letter to mother came today
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better, he's already dead

I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away
In an ancient light that is not of day
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell
<END TEXT>
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin, backstabbin phony I didnt wanna have to be dealin with
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
Well, I cried for younow its your turn to cry awhile

I dont carry deadweightIm no flash in the pan
All right, Ill set you straight, cant you see Im a union man?
Im lettin the cat out of the cage, Im keeping a low profile
Well, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile

Feel like a fighting roosterfeel better than I ever felt
But the Pennsylvania lines in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile
Well, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile

Last night cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin a two A.M. booty call
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
Well, I cried for younow its your turn to cry awhile

Im on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I cant control
Some people they aint human, they got no heart or soul
Well, Im crying to the LordIm tryin to be meek and mild
Yes, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile

Well, theres preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
Im longin for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
Im gonna buy me a barrel of whiskeyIll die before I turn senile
Well, I cried for younow its your turn, you can cry awhile

Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
I always said youd be sorry and today could be the day
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
Well, I cried for you, now its your turn, you can cry awhile

Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
Theyre drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 2]
A cock is crowing far away and another soldiers deep in prayer
Some mothers child has gone astray, she cant find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom natures beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 3]
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, Im sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 4]
Oh, the French girl, shes in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out

Day out, day in

When I awake I awake with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
The oceans roar, a thousand drums

Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is

Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

[Verse 2]
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave, I was already walking
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

[Verse 3]
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldnt fall on me
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me

[Verse 4]
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me
Singing for me, well, singing for me

I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49"

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old

A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49

There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein

[Verse 4]
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49

[Verse 6]
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast

[Verse 1]
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine
Never being able to separate the good from the bad
Ooh, I cant stand it, I cant stand it
Its making me feel so sad

[Chorus]
Dead man, dead man
When will you arise?
Cobwebs in your mind
Dust upon your eyes

[Verse 2]
Satan got you by the heel, theres a birds nest in your hair
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move
Ooh, I cant stand it, I cant stand it
What are you trying to prove?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in
The race of the engine that overrules your heart
Ooh, I cant stand it, I cant stand it
Pretending that youre so smart

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
What are you trying to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?
The tuxedo that youre wearing, the flower in your lapel
Ooh, I cant stand it, I cant stand it
You want to take me down to hell

Dear landlord
Please dont put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
Im gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

[Verse 2]
Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know youve suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

[Verse 3]
Dear landlord
Please dont dismiss my case
Im not about to argue
Im not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you dont underestimate me
I wont underestimate you

Dear Mrs.Roosevelt, don't hang your head and cry
His mortal flesh is laid away but his good work fills the sky
This world was lucky to see him born

Now he went up to grade school and he wrote back to his folks
He drew such funny pictures and was always pulling jokes
This world was lucky to see him born

He went up to Harvard to read his books of law
He loved his trees and horses, he loved everything he saw
This world was lucky to see him born

He got struck down by the fever and it settled in his leg
He loved the folks that wished him well and everybody did
This world was lucky to see him born

He took office on a crippled leg and he said to one and all
"Your money changing racket, boys, sure enough got to fall."
This world was lucky to see him born

I voted for him lots of times and I'd vote for him again
He tried to find an honest job for every idle man
This world was lucky to see him born

He helped me to build my union and he learned me how to talk
I could see he was a cripple but he learned my soul to talk
This world was lucky to see him born

I was a GI in the army the day he passed away
And over my shoulder I could hear some soldier say
"This world was lucky to see him born."

I know this world was lucky just to see him born
I know this world was lucky just to see him born
This world was lucky to see him born

Death don't have no mercy in this land
It don't have no mercy in this land
When i come in your house someday
And i'll take your mother away
Death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no judgement in this land x2
When i come in your house someday
And i'll take your father away
Death don't have no judgement in this land

[Verse 1]
When youre sad and when youre lonely
And you havent got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that youve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Verse 2]
When youre standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you dont know whats up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Verse 3]
When the storm clouds gather round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And theres no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Bridge]
Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies

[Verse 4]
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down
All the friends I ever had are gone

Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest
All the friends I ever had are gone

Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home
All the friends I ever had are gone

Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four
All the friends I ever had are gone

High up on the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me
All the friends I ever had are gone

Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight
All the friends I ever had are gone

Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."
All the friends I ever had are gone

Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
All the friends I ever had are gone

Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up
All the friends I ever had are gone

Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
You loved all them rounders, never did love me
All the friends I ever had are gone

Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me
All the friends I ever had are gone

Gal, what's on your mind?
Denise, Denise
Gal, what's on your mind?
You got your eyes closed
Heaven knows that you ain't blind

Well, I can see you smiling
But oh your mouth is inside out
I can see you smiling
But you're smiling inside out
Well, I know you're laughin'
But what are you laughin' about

Well, if you're tryin' to throw me
Babe, I've already been tossed
If you're tryin' to throw me
Babe, I've already been tossed
Babe, you're tryin' to lose me
Babe, I'm already lost

Well, what are you doing
Are you flying or have you flipped?
Oh, what are you doing
Are you flying or have you flipped?
Well, you call my name
And then say your tongue just slipped

Denise, Denise
You're concealed here on the shelf
Denise, Denise
You're concealed here on the shelf
I'm looking deep in your eyes, babe
And all I can see is myself

They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town

Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker
The other is in his pants

And the riot squad, they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
"It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pocket
Bette Davis style

And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
"You belong to me, I believe"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave"

And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside

All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody's making love
Or else expecting rain

And the good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival
Tonight on Desolation Row

Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her 22nd birthday
She already is an old maid

To her death is quite romantic
She wears an ironed vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness

And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking into
Desolation Row

Einstein disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk

Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet

You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They are trying to blow it up

Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
"Have mercy on his soul"

They all play on the penny whistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The phantom of the opera
In a perfect image of a priest

They are spoon-feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the phantom shouting to skinny girls
"Get out of here if you don't know"
Casanova is just being punished
For going to Desolation Row

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do

And they bring them to the factory
Where their heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene

Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
"Which side are you on?"

And Ezra Pound and T.S. Elliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers

Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?

All these people that you mentioned
Yes, I know them, they are quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name

Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them from
Desolation Row

[Verse 1]
Now There's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe

[Verse 2]
And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law

[Verse 3]
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
Did offer him my hand
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand

[Verse 4]
And I nearly starved to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe

[Verse 5]
Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy
With the wagging of his jaw

[Verse 6]
And the telling of his story
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe

Instrumental

[Verse 7]
Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so
I'm still punching cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe

[Verse 8]
And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low
Searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin' out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou
She said "Don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn't any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin' cross the sliver sand
Steps goin' down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
To find dignity

Searching every bloodsucking thing in sight

Would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need

Death is standing in the doorway of life

Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

[Verse 15]
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

[Verse 16]
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, Im at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what its going to take
To find dignity

Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
Thin man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield
For dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
Young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low
Searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breakin' out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance
Of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou
She said "Don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've got deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn't any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

Footprints runnin' cross the sliver sand
Steps goin' down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake

Most of the time, I'm clear focused all around
Most of the time, I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the sign
Stay right with it when the road upwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don't even notice she's gone
Most of the time

Most of the time, I'm cool underneath
Most of the time, I can keep it right between my teeth
I can solve any riddle, I can hold my own
Deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
I don't even think about her
Most of the time

Most of the time, my head is on straight
Most of the time, I'm strong enough not to hate
I got enough faith and I got enough strength
I keep it all away, way beyond arm length
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time

Most of the time, she ain't even in my mind
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind
Most of the time, I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her

Most of the time, I'm halfways content
Most of the time, I know exactly where it all went
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don't compromise nor pretend
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time

[Verse 1]
If I had wings
Like Noah's Dove
Id fly the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 2]
I had a man
Who was long and tall
Moved his body
Like a cannonball
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 3]
Remember one evening
Was drizzling rain
And around my heart
I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 4]
Once I wore
My apron low
Couldnt keep you
Away from my door
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 5]
Now my apron
Is up to my chin
You pass my door
But you never come in
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 6]
Oh, mighty river
Runs muddy and wild
Cant care the bloody
For my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 7]
Number 9 train
Wont do no harm
Number 9 train
Take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 8]
Fastest man
I ever saw
Skipped Missouri
On the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

If I had wings like noah's dove
I'd fly up the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

If I met your man, who was long and tall
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

When I wore my apron low
Couldn't keep you from my do'
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now I wear my apron high
Scarcely ever see you passing by
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well

Now my apron's up to my chin
You pass my door and you won't come in
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home in my mama's bed
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

[Verse 1]
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving you and Im glad the curtain fell

[Verse 2]
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin

[Verse 3]
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, hes beaten till hes tame
All for a moments glory and its a dirty, rotten shame

[Verse 4]
There are those who worship loneliness, Im not one of them
In this age of fiberglass Im searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasnt shown me nothing yet
Ive paid the price of solitude, but at least Im out of debt

[Verse 5]
Cant recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each others eyes till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?

[Verse 6]
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where Im at
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Gone walk down that dirt road, til someone lets me ride
Gone walk down that dirt road, til someone lets me ride
If I cant find my baby, Im gonna run away and hide

[Verse 2]
I have been pacing around the room hoping maybe shed come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe shed come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying round in a one-room country shack

[Verse 3]
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Till theres nothing left to see, tell the chains have been shattered
And Ive been freed

[Verse 4]
I been looking at my shadow, I have been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love

[Verse 5]
Gone walk on down that dirt road till Im right beside the sun
Gone walk on down until Im right beside the sun
Im gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone

Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

In Dixie Land where i was born
Early on one frosty morn
Look away, look away, look away to Dixie Land

I wish I was in Dixie
Away, away
In Dixie Land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
Away, away, away down south in Dixie

Lots of folks back east they say
"Hello" every day
Hitting the hard old dusty way to the California line
Across that desert sand they go
They're getting out of the old dust bowl
They think they're going to a sugar bowl
But here is what they find
Oh the police at the port of entry say
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"

And, well if you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is the garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not
You won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi

If you want a house or farm
That won't do nobody harm
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea
Don't swap that old cow for a car
Better stay right where you are
You had better take this tip from me
Cause I read it in the want ads every day
And the headlines on the papers always say

If you ain't got the do re mi, boy
If you ain't got the do re mi
Better go on back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee
California is a garden of eden
A paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not

Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

[Verse 3]
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold

[Verse 4]
Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere!
Listen to what I say
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
Will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, I think you're the one
I can't imagine anybody doin'
More to me than you do

Dearest, if it's your heart that I won
There's no need for blame
And no reason to be ashamed
Of that place where we stand in the sun

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, let us not drift apart
It wouldn't be wise
It wouldn't be civilized
It wouldn't be smart

Time heals a broken heart
You've been hurt
You've been left in the dirt
But you still look brand new to me

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walkin' behind you

Dearest, you're the answer to my prayers
Words can't express
If my heart would confess
What you mean to me

Dearest, I can't help knowin' that you're the best
I don't have to feel you to know that you're real
You're more than a dream to me

Don't ever take yourself away
Don't ever take yourself
To a place where I can't find you
Don't ever take yourself away

I will never leave you
I will never deceive you
I'll be right there walking behind you

Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that youre trying to achieve, girl?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Whove lost all ray of hope
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope

[Chorus]
Dont fall apart on me tonight
I just dont think that I could handle it
Dont fall apart on me tonight
Yesterdays just a memory
Tomorrow is never what its supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I cant see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I cant take you there
I wished Id have been a doctor
Maybe Id have saved some life that've been lost
Maybe Id have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed

[Chorus]
Dont fall apart on me tonight
I just dont think that I could handle it
Dont fall apart on me tonight
Yesterdays just a memory
Tomorrow's never what its supposed to be
And I need you, ah, yeah

[Verse 3]
I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could Id bring you to the mountain top, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But its like Im stuck inside a painting
Thats a-hanging in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I cant move

[Chorus]
Dont fall apart on me tonight
I just dont think that I could handle it
Dont fall apart on me tonight
Yesterdays gone but the past live' on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, ah

[Bridge]
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you whats wrong from whats right?
Oh, do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line

[Verse 4]
Lets try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charms
No more affection thats misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didnt dance

[Chorus]
Dont fall apart on me tonight
I just dont think that I could handle it
Dont fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what its supposed to be
And I need you
Yeah, you, ah
I need you

A-looking around just to see whos born

Is lookin around, I wouldnt say when
I looked down low, I looked above
And who did I see but the one I love
She said, Dont ya tell Henry

Apples got your fly

Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve

I looked for a cow and I saw me a few

I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long, honey baby
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin my way
Down along the cove

Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try an' move me, you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's sugar for sugar and salt for salt
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Well, that high tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

[Intro]
The light in this place is really bad
Like being at the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
Im expecting to wake up from a dream

[Verse 1]
Means so much, the softest touch
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
I pondered my faith in the rain
Ive been dreaming of you, thats all I do
And its driving me insane

[Verse 2]
Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking across the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who theyre ringing for

[Verse 3]
Travel under any star
Youll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
Im sleeping in the palace of pain
Ive been dreaming of you, thats all I do
But its driving me insane

[Verse 4]
Maybe theyll get me, maybe they wont
But whatever it wont be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

[Verse 5]
For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they never, ever explain
Ive been dreaming of you, thats all I do
And its driving me insane

[Verse 6]
Well, I eat when Im hungry, drink when Im dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It wont matter, long as youre there

[Verse 7]
Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreaming of you is all I do
But its driving me insane

[Verse 8]
Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual fall
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in the storm

[Verse 9]
Maybe you were here and maybe you werent
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
Im dreaming of you, thats all I do
But its driving me insane

The light
In this place
Is really bad
Like being
In the bottom
Of a stream
Any minute now
I'm expecting
To wake up
From a dream
Miss so much
The softest touch
Like the grave
Of some child child
Who neither wept
Nor smiled
I'm hiding my faith
In the rain
I've been
Dreamin' of you
That's all I do
And it's
Driving me insane

Where the moon is wide

For years
They had me
Locked in a cage
Then they threw me
Onto the stage
Somethings
Just last longer
Then you
Thought they would
And they never
Ever explain

Is so shy like the day
In queer and unusual form
Spirals of golden haze here
In there in a blaze

Or maybe you weren't
Maybe you
Touched somebody
And got burned

Has got me on the run

[Verse 1]
Oh, help me in my weakness
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
My trip hasnt been a pleasant one
And my time it isnt long
And I still do not know
What it was that Ive done wrong

[Verse 2]
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
You fail to understand, he said
Why must you even try?
Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more

[Verse 3]
Oh, stop that cursed jury
Cried the attendant and the nurse
The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while evrybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I didnt know that youd be leaving
Or who you thought you were talking to
I figure maybe were even
Or maybe Im one up on you

[Verse 2]
I send you all my money
Just like I did before
I tried to reach you honey
But youre drifting too far from shore

[Chorus]
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore

[Verse 3]
I aint gonna get lost in this current
I dont like playing cat and mouse
No gentleman likes making love to a servant
Especially when hes in his fathers house

[Verse 4]
I never could guess your weight, baby
Never needed to call you my whore
I always thought you were straight, baby
But youre drifting too far from shore

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted
The bottom of the barrel is too
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted
Everybody cant be as lucky as you

[Verse 6]
Never no more do I wonder
Why you dont never play with me anymore
At any moment you could go under
Cause youre drifting too far from shore

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
You and me we had completeness
I give you all of what I could provide
We werent on the wrong side, sweetness
We were the wrong side

[Verse 8]
Ive already ripped out the phones, honey
You cant walk the streets in a war
I can finish this alone honey
Youre drifting too far from shore

Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, little star
Up comes Brady in a 'lectric car
Got a mean look all 'round his eye
Gonna shoot somebody jus' to see them die
Duncan, Duncan was tending the bar
In walked Brady with a shining star
And Brady says, "Duncan you are under arrest"
And Duncan shot a hole in Brady's breast
Brady, Brady carried a .45
Said it would shoot half a mile
Duncan had a .44
That what laid Mr. Brady so low
Brady fell down on the barroom floor
"Please Mr. Duncan don' shoot me no more"
Women all cryin', ain't it a shame
Shot King Brady, goin' shoot him again
"Brady, Brady, Brady, you know you done wrong
Walkin' in the room when the game was goin' on
Knockin' down windows, breakin' down the door
Now you lyin' dead on the grocery [barroom] floor
Women all heard that Brady was dead
Goes back home and they dresses in red
Come a sniffin' and a sighin' down the street
In their big mother hubbards and their stockin' feet
'Cause he been on the job too long

[Verse 1]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away
I wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day

You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp
But I ain't neither one

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Sounding like it's on a final run

[Verse 2]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she never blowed before
Blue light blinking, red light glowing
Blowing like she's at my chamber door

You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more

[Verse 3]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going
You're like a time bomb in my heart

I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling
Must be the mother of our Lord

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like my woman's on board

[Verse 4]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day

I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead

[Verse 5]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no good town

The lights on my native land are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she's blowing right on time

By Bob Dylan

Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring
The trucks and the trailers will be winding
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling

As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

It's a-many a friend that follows the bend
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents
Get that canvas flag a-flying
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds
Just behind the posters that are hanging
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind
Hear that old music box a-banging
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling

It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town
Hit the old highway by the morning
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time
Following them fairgrounds a-calling

As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime
Drinking red wine as we're rolling
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn
From following them fairgrounds a-calling

And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em
And the money that we made will pay for the space
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling

In the early morning rain, with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart, and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home, and I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain, with nowhere to go

Out on runway number nine, a big 707's set to go
I'm stuck here in the ground, where the cold wind blows
The liquor tasted good, and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend, she's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall, and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home, in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be
You can't jump a jet plane, like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way, in the early morning rain

All the early Roman Kings in their sharkskin suits
Bowties and buttons, high top boots
Driving the spikes in, blazing the rails
Nailed in their coffins in top hats and tails
Fly away little bird, fly away, flap your wings
Fly by night like the early Roman Kings

All the early Roman Kings in the early, early morn
Coming down the mountain, distributing the corn
Speeding through the forest, racing down the track
You try to get away, they drag you back
Tomorrow is Friday, well see what it brings
Everybodys talking bout the early Roman Kings

Theyre peddlers and theyre meddlers, they buy and they sell
They destroyed your city, theyll destroy you as well
Theyre lecherous and treacherous, hell bent for leather
Each of them bigger than all men put together
Sluggers and muggers wearing fancy gold rings
All the women going crazy for the early Roman Kings

I'll dress up your wounds with a blood clotted rag
I aint afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag
If you see me coming and youre standing there
Wave your handkerchief in the air
I aint dead yet, my bell still rings
I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman Kings

I'll strip you of life, strip you of breath
Ship you down to the house of death
One day you will ask for me
Therell be no one else that youll want to see
Bring down my fiddle, tune up my strings
Gonna break it wide open like the early Roman Kings

I was up on black mountain the day Detroit fell
They killed them all off and they sent them to hell
Ding Dong Daddy, youre coming up short
Gonna put you on trial in a Sicilian court
Ive had my fun, Ive had my flings
Gonna shake em all down like the early Roman Kings

Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket
Never let it slip away
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray
When you get half crazy from the August heat
Or on a frozen, rotted road
With no one to complain to 'bout your achin' feet
You're gonna walk that endless highway
Walk that highway till you die
All you children goin' my way
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye
When I see a detour up ahead
Well, I leave it far behind
Who knows what you're apt to find there
With the cost of livin', and the price of dyin'
Well it look like to me, this time I won't be buyin'
You're gonna walk that endless highway
Walk that highway till you die
All you children goin' my way
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye
When they get a scapegoat by the throat
It's hard labor and cold beans
If you get away quick you'll be eatin' from the poison peanut machines
Well, I sing by night, oh and wander by day
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay
You're gonna walk that endless highway, endless highway
Walk that highway till you die
All you children goin' my way, goin' my way
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye, yeah you tell 'em bye

[Verse 1]
I sang the song slowly
As she stood in the shadows
She stepped to the light
As my silver strings spun
She called with her eyes
To the tune Is a-playing
But the song it was long
And Id only begun

[Verse 2]
Through a bullet of light
Her face was reflecting
The fast fading words
That rolled from my tongue
With a long-distance look
Her eyes was on fire
But the song it was long
And there was more to be sung

[Verse 3]
My eyes danced a circle
Across her clear outline
With her head tilted sideways
She called me again
As the tune drifted out
She breathed hard through the echo
But the song it was long
And it was far to the end

[Verse 4]
I glanced at my guitar
And played it pretending
That of all the eyes out there
I could see none
As her thoughts pounded hard
Like the pierce of an arrow
But the song it was long
And it had to get done

[Verse 5]
As the tune finally folded
I laid down the guitar
Then looked for the girl
Whod stayed for so long
But her shadow was missing
For all of my searching
So I picked up my guitar
And began the next song
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
Theres a dyin voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

[Verse 2]
Dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the Masters hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand

[Verse 3]
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay

[Verse 4]
I gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

[Verse 5]
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summers dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face

[Verse 6]
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, theres someone there, other times its only me
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

[Harmonica solo]

Broken lines, broken strings
Broken threads, broken springs
Broken idols, broken heads
People sleeping in broken beds
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking
Everything is broken

Broken bottles, broken plates
Broken switches, broken gates
Broken dishes, broken parts
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken

Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground

Broken cutters, broken saws
Broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking
Everything is broken

Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face

Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties, broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools
People bending broken rules
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking
Everything is broken

Broken nights, broken days
Broken leaves on broken trees
Broken treaties, broken vows
Broken hands on broken ploughs
Ain't no use runnin', honey
Ain't no use jokin'
Nothin's workin'
Everything broken

Broken lives hangin' by a thread
Broken bones in a broken bed
Broken mirror, broken chair
Broken roads goin' nowhere
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Can't help it honey
Everything broken

I sent you roses once from a heart that was truely grieved
Sent you roses someone else must have received

Broken clock on a broken wall
Broken voices in a broken hall
Broken beginnings, broken ends
Streets are filled with broken friends
Take a deep breath, baby, feel like you're chokin'
Tell me the truth now
Everything broken

Seen James Dean in a picture once, comin' in from the cold
Said, "Geez I hope to look that good, if I get to be that old."

Broken plants on a broken floor
Broken key for a broken door
Broken idols, broken heroes
Broken numbers adding up the zeroes
Hound dogs howlin', bull frogs croakin'
It ain't easy, baby
Everything broken

[Verse 1]

Farewell Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
The music play slow
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire
And I must go

[Verse 2]
There is no use in talking
And there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove
Evrything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina
The sky's changing colours
And I must leave

[Verse 3]
The jacks and the queens
They forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I'll see you after a while

[Verse 4]
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors
Clap and cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky it is trembling
And I must leave fast

[Verse 5]
King Kong, little elves
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is flooding over
And I must be gone

[Verse 6]
The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about
Suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
Perfect must die
Farewell Angelina
The sky's flooding over
And I must go where it is dry


[Verse 7]
Machine guns are roaring
Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
And at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
But farewell Angelina
The sky is erupting
And I must go where it's quiet

[Verse 1]
Oh its fare thee well my darling true
Im leaving in the first hour of the morn
Im bound off for the bay of Mexico
Or maybe the coast of Californ
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day, another time
It aint the leavin
Thats a-grievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind

Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain shes a-turnin into hail

Though Im traveling on a path beaten trail
So its fare thee well my own true love

Well meet another day, another time
It aint the leaving
Thats a-grievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind

[Verse 4]
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
Be them somebody elses or my own
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day, another time
It aint the leaving
Thats a-grievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind

[Verse 5]
Ive heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound
Its down around the old Mexican plains
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day, another time
It aint the leaving
Thats a-grievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind

Father of night, Father of day
Father, who taketh the darkness away
Father, who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of love and Father of rain

[Verse 2]
Father of day, Father of night
Father of black, Father of white
Father, who build the mountain so high
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky
Father of time, Father of dreams
Father, who turneth the rivers and streams

[Verse 3]
Father of grain, Father of wheat
Father of cold and Father of heat
Father of air and Father of trees
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories
Father of minutes, Father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise

Down over the window
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleysthrough the blinds
Another one of them endless days

Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
Im in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her

I keep listening for footsteps
But I aint hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many

A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin in
Sometimes its just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind

The old men round here, sometimes they get
On bad terms with the younger men
But old, young, age dont carry weight
It doesnt matter in the end

One of the boss hangers-on
Comes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully yastrong-arm youinspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect

Theres a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot-six across
Burns with the bark still on

They say times are hard, if you dont believe it
You can just follow your nose
It dont bother metimes are hard everywhere
Well just have to see how it goes

My old man, hes like some feudal lord
Got more lives than a cat
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat

You can smell the pinewood burning
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you wanna learn anything

Romeo, he said to Juliet, You got a poor complexion
It doesnt give your appearance a very youthful touch!
Juliet said back to Romeo, Why dont you just shove off
If it bothers you so much

They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
All the rest of them rebel rivers

If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
Im not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
Ive seen enough heartaches and strife

My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I dont know if they had any dreams or hopes

I had them once though, I suppose, to go along
With all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves

Its not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a whileit can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, its too much to ask
<END TEXT>
I hear that train a-coming, it's coming round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
But I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, time keeps dragging on
And that train keeps on rolling down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mamma told me; "Son
Always be a good boy, don't fool around with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in fancy dining cars
I bet they're drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-moving, and that's what torture me

Well if they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
You bet I moved it on down, a little further down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I wanna stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang Danny Boy at his funeral and the Lords Prayer
Preacher talking bout Christ betrayed
Its like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down

[Chorus]
Well, there aint no goin back
When your foot of pride come down
Aint no goin back

[Verse 2]
Hear ya got a brother named James, dont forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall-by-the sword love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformitys in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Theres a retired businessman named Red
Cast down from heaven and hes out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
Hes not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
Shell do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread
Spice buns in your bed
If you dont mind sleeping with your head face down in a grave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, theyll choose a man for you to meet tonight
Youll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage theyll be trying to get water out rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing Amazing Grace all the way to the Swiss banks

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They dont believe in mercy
Judgement on them is something that youll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Aint nothin left here partner, just the dust of a plague
That has left this whole town afraid
From now on, thisll be where youre from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

[Chorus]

Forgetful heart
Lost your power of recall
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better then you

[Verse 2]
Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer

[Verse 3]
Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before

[Verse 4]
Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore
If indeed there ever was a door

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times all are gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way

Think I'll go down to Alberta
Where there's good there in the fall
I've got some friends that I can go workin' for
But I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if you ever come this way

(A few lines are inaudible)
But by then it would be springtime
There ain't too much for you to do
So I see you when I pass this way again

Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change
Come what may
But the good times are all gone
And I'm bound for movin' on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

Frankie was a good girl
Everybody knows
Paid one hundred dollars
For Albert's new suit of clothes
He was her man that done her wrong
Albert said, "I'm leaving you"
Won't be gone for long
Don't wait up for me
A-worry about me when I'm gone
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went down to the corner saloon
Get a bucket of beer
Said to the bartender
"Has my lovin' man been here?"
He was her man but he done her wrong
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story
I ain't gonna tell you no lie
I saw Albert an hour ago
With a gal named Alice Bly"
If he is her man he done her wrong
Frankie went down to 12th street
Look up through the window high
She saw her Albert there
Lovin' up Alice Bly
He was her man, he would done her wrong
Frankie pulled out a pistol
Pulled out a forty-four
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot
And Albert fell on the floor
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie got down upon her knees
Took Albert into her lap
Started to hug and kiss him
But there was no bringin' him back
He was her man, he done her wrong
Gimme a thousand policemen
Throw me into a cell
I shot my Albert dead
And now I'm goin' to hell
He was my man but he done me wrong
Judge said to the jury
"Plain as a thing can be
A woman shot her lover down
Murder in the second degree"
He was her man but he done her wrong
Frankie went to the scaffold
Calm as a girl could be
Turned her eyes up toward the heavens
Said "Near my God, to Thee"
He was her man but he done her wrong

Freedom for the stallion
Freedom for the mare and her colt
Freedom for the baby child
Who has not grown old enough to vote
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money "God"
It's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Big ship's a-sailing, slaves all chained and bound
Heading for a brand new land that some cat said he upped and found
Lord, have mercy, what you gonna do about the people who are praying to you?
They got men making laws that destroy other men
They've made money "God"
It's a doggone sin
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Some sing a sad song
Some got to moan the blues
Trying to make the best of a home
That the man didn't even get to choose
Lord, have mercy, how you gonna be with people like John and me
They've got men building fences to keep other men out
Ignore him if he whispers and kill him if he shouts
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way
Oh, Lord, you got to help them find the way
Oh, Lord, you got to help us find the way

I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was it taught me how to cry
The holler of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

[Verse 2]
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
She was the only daughter of an engineer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

[Verse 3]
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I want to go I never can go
Because you know I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes

[Verse 1]
I got this graveyard woman, you know
She keeps my kids
But my soulful mama, you know
She keeps me hid
Shes a junkyard angel, and she
Always gives me bread

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Verse 2]
Well, when the pipeline gets broken
And I'm lost on the river bridge
Im all cracked up on the highway
And in the waters edge
Here again she comes, down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with her thread

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Verse 3]
Well, she dont make me nervous
She dont talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she dont need no crutch
She keeps this .410
All loaded with lead

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Bridge]
Come on!

[Verse 4]
Well, you know I
Need a steam shovel, mama, to
Keep away the dead
I need a dump truck, baby, to
Unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said

[Chorus]
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Full moon and empty arms
The moon is there for us to share
But where are you?
A night like this could weave a memory
And every kiss could start a dream for two

Full moon and empty arms
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you

Come around you rovin gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will OConley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblinest man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

Sailin down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
Theyre still talkin about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
Ive come to win some money, Gamblin Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffin or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didnt even have a pair
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

It was late one evenin during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willies cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

So all you rovin gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead mans hand, your gamblin days are up
And its ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gamblin now, nobody really knows

Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds, the cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun, though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms, its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail, though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden

The savage soldier just sticks his head in sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf, but still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, sidesaddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise, you will not hear a laugh
All except inside the gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership, they whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden

The motorcycle black Madonna, two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey who pick upon his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden

The kingdoms of experience, in the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions, each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon a bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly, totally free to do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden

I woke up this mornin'
There were tears in my bed
They killed a man I really loved
Shot him through the head
Lord, Lord
They cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord
They laid him in the ground

Sent him off to prison
For a seventy-dollar robbery
Closed the door behind him
And they threw away the key
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord
They laid him in the ground

He wouldn't take shit from no one
He wouldn't bow down or kneel
Authorities, they hated him
Because he was just too real
Lord, Lord
They cut George Jackson down

Lord, Lord
They laid him in the ground

Prison guards, they cursed him
As they watched him from above
But they were frightened of his power
They were scared of his love
Lord, Lord
So they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord
They laid him in the ground

Sometimes I think this whole world
Is one big prison yard
Some of us are prisoners
The rest of us are guards

You know there's two old maids layin' in the bed
One picked up an' the other one she said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me

Well, you know there late one night up on Blueberry Hill
One man turned to the other man an' said with a blood curdlin' chill, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me

Well, you know we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek
One man said to the other man he began to speak, he said
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off-a me

Well, you know we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus
All kinds of little children on the sideroad they was hollerin' at us, sayin'
Get your rocks off, get your rocks off

[Chorus 1: Bob Dylan]
If youre travelin' to the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
See for me that her hair's hangin' down
It curls and falls all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hangin' down
That's the way I remember her best

If you go when the snowflakes fall
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

If youre travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Please say hello (Remember me) to the one who lives there

Go back to her
Where you'll be more secure
She knows you better than I do
Go 'way little boy

I don't wanna to see you bleed
She's the one that you need
You'll never miss what you ain't never had
Go 'way little boy
You're making me sad
Go 'way little boy
It's much too late
Walk back out the door
Don't wanna see you here no more
You're making it hard for me to concentrate
Go 'way little boy
It's much too late
Can't you hear your mama callin'
Don't you recognize her voice
I think you'd better heed her warning
While you still have the choice
Go 'way little boy
You're much too late
Your future's lookin' bright
Don't throw it away tonight
It's getting hard for me to look you in the eye
Go 'way little boy
Can't you see that you're makin' me cry

God dont call it treason

God knows its fragile

God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string

God knows its terrifying
God sees it all unfold
Theres a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold

God knows that when you see it
God knows youve got to weep
God knows the secrets of your heart
Hell tell them to you when youre asleep

God knows theres a river
God knows how to make it flow
God knows you aint gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go

God knows theres a purpose
God knows theres a chance
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance

God knows theres a heaven
God knows its out of sight
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Even if weve got to walk a million miles by candlelight

There are worse ways of getting there
And I aint complainin none
If the clouds dont drop and the train dont stop
Im bound to meet the sun

[Verse 5]
Now, if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks

Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waitin for me to come

Went to see that gypsy woman, have my fortune told, have my fortune told

I got a 32 special built on a cross of wood

Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, for youre approaching me
Moonlight on the water, fishermans daughter, floating in to my room
With a golden loom

[Verse 2]
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste
And then you drift away on a summers day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom

[Verse 3]
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil
But youre gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom

So much oppression
Cant keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Cant keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
And old men turning young daughters into whores

[Verse 3]
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land

[Verse 4]
Well dont know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Well dont know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule

[Verse 5]
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
But theres only one authority
And thats the authority on high

[Verse 6]
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
She can do the Georgia crawl

Jesus said, Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come
Jesus said, Be ready

About the same time He made the earth

Well, we live by the Golden Rule
Whoever's got the gold, rules
The sun is shining
Ain't but one train on this track
The sun is shining
Ain't but one train on this track
I'm stepping out of the dark woods
Trying to jump on the monkey's back
Yes, I'm all dressed up
Goin' to the country dance
I said I'm all dressed up
Goin' to the country dance
Everyday you've got to pray for guidance
Everyday you've got to give yourself a chance
There are storms on the ocean
Storms out on the mountains too
Storms on the ocean
Storms on the mountains too
Oh Lord
You know I have no friend without you
I'll tell you something
Things you never had you'll never miss
I'll tell you something
Things you never had you'll never miss
I'll tell you something else, a great man will kill you with a sword
A coward with a kiss

FEBRUARY 7, 2015, 2:13 PM _
There are a few people we need to thank tonight for bringing about this grand event. Neil Portnow, Dana Tamarkin, Rob Light, Brian Greenbaum, Don Was. And also want to thank President Carter for coming. Its been a long night, and I dont want to talk too much, but Ill say a few things. I'm glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, I think of as mystery plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been traveling on hard ground. I need to mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, the great talent scout, who way back when brought me to Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All non-commercial artists. Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that. Lou Levy ran Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like "Stardust," he'd turn it down because it would be too late. He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that. Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude.I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group. They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me. The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of my songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it. Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs, if anybody was going to do it. Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. She was an artist a definitely looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she learned directly from me, sitting in a dressing room. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken and dynamite to see perform. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about. Nina was the kind of artist that I loved and admired. Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. After he became famous, he took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here. Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, I met him in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. "Big River," "I Walk the Line." "How Highs The Water, Mama?" I wrote "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, "How high is the water, mama?" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing. In Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or do. They just didn't do that kind of thing where he came from. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice. People would say, "What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby looking waif?" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, "Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs." We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Loyal, free minded and fiercely independent. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman of devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back. These songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music. I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them, back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone. For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once. If you sang "John Henry" as many times as me -- "John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand."If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written "How many roads must a man walk down?" too. Big Bill Broonzy had a song called "Key to the Highway." "I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow." I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write, Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldnt give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said theres only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61 You'd have written that too if you'd sang "Key to the Highway" as much as me. "Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away." "I'm sailing away my own true love." "Boots of Spanish Leather" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that. "Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / Roll the cotton down/A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down." If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing "I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more," too. If youd had listened to the Robert Johnson singing, Better come in my kitchen, cause its gonna be raining out doors, as many time as I listened to it, sometime later you just might write, A Hard Rains a-Gonna Fall. I sang a lot of "come all you" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too many to be counted. "Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail." Or, "Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well. "Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again." And then theres this one, "Gather 'round, people / A story I will tell / 'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, the outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well."If you sung all these "come all ye" songs all the time like I did, you'd be writing, "Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are achanging." You'd have written that too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all you know. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense. "When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women on Deep Ellum put you on the rocks." Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, "When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravitys down and negativity don't pull you through / Dont put on any airs / When youre down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you." All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary. Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway. Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down and youve just got to bear it. In a sense everything evened itself out. Leiber and Stoller didnt think much of my songs. They didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. "Yakety yak, don't talk back." "Charlie Brown is a clown," "Baby I'm a hog for you." Novelty songs, not serious. Doc's songs, they were better. "This Magic Moment." "Lonely Avenue." Save the Last Dance for Me. Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs. Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, LaVerne Baker, just to name a few. There were some great records in there, no doubt about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical artists that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolutionaries with vision and foresight. Fearless and sensitive at the same time. Revolution in style and scope. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day. Merle Haggard didn't think much of my songs, but Buck Owens did, and Buck even recorded some of my early songs. Now I admire Merle -- "Mama Tried," "Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down," "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive." I understand all that but I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing "The Bottle Let Me Down." I love Merle but hes not Buck. Buck Owens wrote "Together Again" and that song trumps anything that ever came out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out. What Im saying here is that my songs seem to divide people. Even people in the music community. People in the critical world too. Critics have always been on my tail since day one. Seems like theyve always given me special treatment. Some of the music critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't these same critics say similar things about Tom Waits? They say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. Why don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free? What have I done to deserve this special treatment? Why me lord? No vocal range? When's the last time youve read that about Dr. John? Youve never read that about Dr John. Why don't they say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. You have to wonder if these critics have ever heard Charley Patton or Son House or Wolf. Talk about slurred words and no diction. Why dont they say those same things about them. "Why me, Lord?" Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving. After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note - - that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a onesyllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny.Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do. Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, "Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth." Think about that the next time you are listening to a singer. Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about. Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called "Country Road." Tom was going off in this interview -- "But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that." Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio. It was called "I Love." I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleep without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions. Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing. This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat that he was, flew a helicopter into Johnny Cash'sbackyard, not your typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. "Sunday Morning Coming Down." Well, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt. And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet Found my cleanest dirty shirt Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day. You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song blew ol Tom T. Hall's world apart. He couldnt see it coming. It might have sent him to the mad house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs. You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked You say, Who is that man? You try so hard But you dont understand Just what you're gonna say When you get home But you dont know what it is Do you, Mister Jones? If "Sunday Morning Coming Down" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the loony bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the loony bin. Hopefully he didn't hear it.I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. Rod of course, even Paul has done some of this kind of material. But the reviews of their records arent like mine. In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, they've got to look under every stone and report about it. In the review they get, you seldom see any of the songwriters names. Unlike mine. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few. But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there with importance and dignity. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it. Traditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: "Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues." Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true. The other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Git Tanner and the Skillet Lickers ... groups like that. Moonshine gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio. You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, and you dont have the hillbilly feeling, youre not really playing Rock n Roll. It might be something else but its not that. You can fake it, but you can't make it. Critics have said that Ive made a career out of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do? That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations. Like I stay up late at night thinking about how to do it. "What do you do for a living, man?" "Oh, I confound expectations." You're going to get a job, the man says, "What do you do?" "Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, "Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you." Confounding expectations. I dont even know what that means or who has time for it.Why me, Lord? My work confounds them obviously, but I really don't know how I do it. The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is "Stand By Me" with the Blackwood Brothers. Not "Stand By Me" the pop song. No. The real "Stand By Me." The real one goes like this: When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou whomever lost a battle / Stand by me In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand/ Thou who knowest all about me / Stand by me That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not for that album, though  a song called "Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood." But I dont know, it might be good on the gospel album too. Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. Who all know how to sing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices. I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a Sun rock 'n' roll artist. He was a true original. He did it all; played, sang and wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You kind of have to take a step back. You just don't stand a chance. So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called "Red Hot," and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life. He did it with power and style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against Metal, Soft Rock, Hard Rock, Psychedelic Pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff. But after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet. And its taking too long. I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard "Red Hot." I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day. I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was. And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called "Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days." It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying. And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, mortgage and gave him spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing. I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams says, "the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.

Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam

She come up the Canadian Rockies where the crystal waters glide
Comes a-roaring down the canyon to meet that salty tide
From the great Pacific Ocean to where the sun sets in the west
That big Grand Coulee country in that land I love the best

In the misty glitter of that wild and windward spray
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave
Once she tore men's boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
That day that Grand Coulee dam went across that wild and restless stream

Oh, Uncle Sam took up the notion in the year of thirty three
For the factory and the farmer and for all of you and me
He said: roll it on Columbia, you can roll out to the sea
But river, while you're rolling you can do some work for me

Now from Washington and Oregon you can hear them factories a-hum
Making corn and making manganese and light aluminum
Always a flying fortress to blast for Uncle Sam
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee dam

Well, the world owns seven wonders as the travellers always tell
Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam's fair land
That King Columbia river and the great Grand Coulee Dam

Well, you asked me if I'll forget my baby
I guess I will, someday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll get along
I guess I will, someway
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

You asked me if I'll miss her kisses
I guess I will, everyday
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
You asked me if I'll find another
I don't know; I can't say
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

God gave me that girl to lean on
Then he put me on my own
Heaven, help me be a man and
Have the strength to stand alone
I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way

Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind

You make me nervous when you start to talk

Standing on the highway, you flag me down
Said, take me Daddy, to the nearest town

The joint is jumping
Its really something
The beat is pumping
My heart is thumping
Spent my money on you honey
My limbs are shaking
My mind is breaking

You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
You make me so mad, I tell you to stop

You wear a blue scarf upon your head
Wearing a long dress fire engine red

That David played, and pleased the Lord
You don't really care for music, do you?

The minor fall, the major lifts
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your faith, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the

Well you say I took the name in vain

It doesn't matter what you heard
The broken or the holy Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Well, I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round

While sailing 'round the ocean
While sailing 'round the sea
I'd think of handsome Molly
Wherever she might be

Don't you remember, Molly
You gave me your right hand?
You said whenever you'd marry
I would be the man

But you broke your promise
Go with whom you please
My poor heart is aching
You are at your ease

I went to church last Sunday
Molly came ridin' by
I could tell her mind was changin'
By the rovin' of her eye

I go down to the river
Though everyone's asleep
I think of handsome Molly
An' I begin to weep

So I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport town
I'd put my foot on a steamboat
I'd sail the ocean 'round

Sing it to you right, but you might think its wrong
Just a little glimpse of a story Ill tell
Bout an East Coast city that you all know well
Its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

Old New York City is a friendly old town
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down
Theres a-mighty many people all milling all around
Theyll kick you when youre up and knock you when youre down
Its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 3]
Well, the weekend is strong and the rich and the poor
Get there together in roof an' no more
Crowdin' up 'bove and crowdin' down below
And someone disappears, you never even know
And it's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town

[Verse 4]
Its a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza n the Empire State
Mister Empire sets up as high as a bird
Old Mister Rockefeller never says a word
Its hard times from the country
Living down in New York town

[Verse 5]
Well, its up in the morning trying to find a job of work
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt
If you got a lot o money you can make yourself merry
If you only got a nickel, its the Staten Island Ferry
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 6]
Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream
Bought your city on a one-way track
F I had my way Id sell it right back
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 7]
Ill take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay
N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines
Its all much cleaner than the New York kind
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

[Verse 8]
So all you newsy people, spread the news around
You can listen to m story, listen to m song
You can step on my name, you can try n get me beat
When I leave New York, Ill be standing on my feet
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town

Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more

Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more

Hark! The herald angels sing

Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with men to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"

[Verse 3]
Hail! The heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail! The Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King"

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

[Verse 2]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

[Verse 3]
Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
I wouldnt be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere
You got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love

[Verse 2]
Hazel, stardust in your eye
Youre going somewhere and so am I
Id give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love

[Verse 3]
Oh no, I dont need any reminder
To know how much I really care
But its just making me blinder and blinder
Because Im up on a hill and still youre not there

[Verse 4]
Hazel, you called and I came
Now dont make me play this waiting game
Youve got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love

He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I think about him now
Lord I just can't keep from crying
Cause he was a friend of mine

[Verse 2]
He died on the road
He died on the road
He never had enough money
To pay his room or board
And he was a friend of mine

[Verse 3]
I stole away and cried
I stole away and cried
Cause I never had too much money
And I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine

[Verse 4]
He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
A thousand miles from home
And he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine

[Verse 5]
He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I hear his name
Lord I just can't keep from crying
Cause he was a friend of mine

Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Right down Santa Claus Lane!
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Are pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 2]
Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Right down Santa Claus Lane!
He's got a bag that is filled with toys
For the boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed, cover up your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams
Funny but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

[Verse 1]
Yes, the gal I got
I swear shes the screaming end
She wants me to be a hero
So she can tell all her friends

[Verse 2]
Well, she begged, she cried
She pleaded with me all last night
Well, she begged, she cried
She pleaded with me all last night
She wants me to go out
And find somebody to fight

[Verse 3]
She reads too many books
She got new movies inside her head
She reads too many books
She got movies inside her head
She wants me to walk out running
She wants me to crawl back dead

[Verse 4]
You need a different kinda man, babe
One that can grab and hold your heart
Need a different kind of man, babe
One that can hold and grab your heart
You need a different kind of man, babe
You need Napoleon Boneeparte

[Verse 5]
Well, when Im dead
No more good times will I crave
When Im dead
No more good times will I crave
You can stand and shout hero
All over my lonesome grave

Come you phoney super patriotic people that say
That hatin' and fearing is my only way
That this here country has got to be
You're thinkin' of yourselves, you ain't thinkin' of me

You're not thinkin' of any George Washington
You're not thinkin' of any Thomas Jefferson
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead
You use their names for aims, for your selfish greed

Don't speak to me of your patriotism
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison
An' you say that the only good niggers are the ones that have died
Don't think I'll ever stand on your side

Though you make it so hard for me to love
My face will never feel the slap of your glove
My cards will never buy..
My hands will never buy the cards that you play
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay

Get out in the open, stop standin' afar
Let the whole world see what a hypocrit you are
I ain't jokin' and it ain't no gag
You bin hidin' too long behind the American flag

High water risin'
Risin' night and day
All the gold and silver
Are being stolen away

Big Joe Turner lookin' East and West
From the dark room of his mind
He made it to Kansas City
Twelfth Street and Vine

Nothing standing there
High water everywhere

High water risin'
The shacks are slidin' down
Folks lose their possessions
Folks are leaving town

Bertha Mason shook it, broke it
Then she hung it on a wall
Says, "You're dancin' with whom they tell you to
Or you don't dance at all."

It's tough out there
High water everywhere

I got a cravin' love for blazing speed
Got a hopped up Mustang Ford
Jump into the wagon, love
Throw your panties overboard

I can write you poems
Make a strong man lose his mind
I'm no pig without a wig
I hope you treat me kind

Things are breakin' up out there
High water everywhere

High water risin'
Six inches 'bove my head
Coffins droppin' in the street
Like balloons made out of lead

Water pourin' into Vicksburg
Don't know what I'm going to do
"Don't reach out for me," she said
"Can't you see I'm drownin' too?"

It's rough out there
High water everywhere

Well, George Lewis told the Englishman
The Italian and the Jew
"You can't open your mind, boys
To every conceivable point of view."

They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
Judge says to the High Sheriff
"I want him dead or alive

Either one, I don't care."
High Water everywhere

The Cuckoo is a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
I'm preachin' the Word of God
I'm puttin' out your eyes

I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat
She said, "Take it off the shelf
As great as you are, man
You'll never be greater than yourself."

I told her I didn't really care
High water everywhere

I'm getting' up in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
Keeping away from the women
I'm givin' 'em lots of room

Thunder rolling over Clarksdale
Everything is looking blue
I just can't be happy, love
Unless you're happy too

It's bad out there
High water everywhere

[Verse 1]
Well my hearts in the Highlands gentle and fair
Honeysuckle blooming in the Wildwood air
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my hearts in the Highland
Im gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

[Verse 2]
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol rat race
Life in the same oil cage

[Verse 3]
I dont want nothing from anyone, aint that much to take
Wouldnt know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

[Verse 4]
Well my hearts in the Highlands wherever I roam
Thats where Ill be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
Well my hearts in the Highland
I can only get there one step at a time

[Verse 5]
Im listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound
Someones always yelling turn it down
Feel like Im drifting
Drifting from scene to scene
Im wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?

[Verse 6]
Insanity is smashing up against my soul
You can say I was on anything but a roll
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top
What would I do with it anyway
Maybe take it to the pawn shop

[Verse 7]
My hearts in the Highlands at the break of dawn
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low
Well my hearts in the Highlands
Only place left to go

[Verse 8]
Im in Boston town, in some restaurant
I got no idea what I want
Well, maybe I do but Im just really not sure
Waitress comes over
Nobody in the place but me and her

[Verse 9]
It must be a holiday, theres nobody around
She studies me closely as I sit down
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
She says, Whatll it be?
I say, I dont know, you got any soft boiled eggs?

[Verse 10]
She looks at me, says, Id bring you some
But were out of m, you picked the wrong time to come
Then she says, I know youre an artist, draw a picture of me!
I say, I would if I could, but
I dont do sketches from memory

[Verse 11]
Well, she says, Im right here in front of you, or havent you looked?
I say, All right, I know, but I dont have my drawing book!
She gives me a napkin, she says, You can do it on that
I say, Yes I could, but
I dont know where my pencil is at!

[Verse 12]
She pulls one out from behind her ear
She says, All right now, go ahead, draw me, Im standing right here
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see
Well she takes the napkin and throws it back
And says, That dont look a thing like me!

[Verse 13]
I said, Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does
She says, You must be joking. I say, I wish I was!
Then she says, You dont read women authors, do you?
Least thats what I think I hear her say
Well, I say, how would you know and what would it matter anyway?

[Verse 14]
Well, she says, you just dont seem like you do!
I said, Youre way wrong
She says, Which ones have you read then? I say, I read Erica Jong!
She goes away for a minute
And I slide up out of my chair
I step outside back to the busy street but nobodys going anywhere

[Verse 15]
Well my hearts in the Highlands with the horses and hounds
Way up in the border country, far from the towns
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
My hearts in the Highlands
Cant see any other way to go

[Verse 16]
Every day is the same thing out the door
Feel further away than ever before
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn
Well, Im lost somewhere
I must have made a few bad turns

[Verse 17]
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
Theyre drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes
All the young men with their young women looking so good
Well, Id trade places with any of them
In a minute, if I could

[Verse 18]
Im crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
Talking to myself in a monologue
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat
Somebody just asked me
If I registered to vote

[Verse 19]
The sun is beginning to shine on me
But its not like the sun that used to be
The partys over and theres less and less to say
I got new eyes
Everything looks far away

[Verse 20]
Well, my hearts in the Highlands at the break of day
Over the hills and far away
Theres a way to get there and Ill figure it out somehow
But Im already there in my mind
And thats good enough for now

Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand

Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son"
Abe said, "Man, you must be puttin' me on"
God said, "No" Abe say, "What?"
God say, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin', you better run"
Well, Abe said, "Where d'you want this killin' done?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61"
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man, I got to run"
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, "That way, down Highway 61"
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
"I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louie the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son"
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61"
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white"
He said, "Come here and step into the light"
He said, "Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done"
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61
Now, the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61"

God say, "You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me comin', you better run"

And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"

And he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61"

Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white"
He said, "Come here and step into the light" he says, "Hmm, you're right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done"

But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the rovin' gambler, he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war

Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty

He was not in this county
He was forty miles away

But they took him 'cross the mountain
And they whomped him on the hill
Yes, they took him on the mountain
And they whomped him on the hill
It was there that he pleaded
Oh, please, let me make my will

But Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty

I've heard a great many say
He was not in this county
He was forty miles away

But they took him down to Danville
And they throwed him in jail
Yes, they took him down to Danville
And they throwed him in jail
And it was then nobody sought him
Nobody could go his bail

But Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty
I've heard a great many say
He was not in this county
He was forty miles away

But they took him out at midnight
And they strapped him to a tree
Yes, they took him out at midnight
And they strapped him to a tree
It was there that they killed him
With rifle bullets three

But Hiram Hubbard was not guilty
Lord, I heard a great many say
Hiram Hubbard wasn't guilty

He was not in this county

Well, Im stranded in the city that never sleeps
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
Im avoidin the Southside the best I can
These memories I got, they can strangle a man

Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Lot of things can get in the way when youre tryin to do whats right
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
Youd be honest with me if only you knew

Im not sorry for nothin Ive done
Im glad I foughtI only wish wed won
The Siamese twins are comin to town
People cant waittheyre gathered around

When I left my home the sky split open wide
I never wanted to go back thereId rather have died
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
Youd be honest with me if only you knew

My woman got a face like a teddy bear
Shes tossin a baseball bat in the air
The meat is so tough you cant cut it with a sword
Im crashin my car, trunk first into the boards

You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
Well, Ill sell it to ya at a reduced price
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
Youd be honest with me, if only you knew

Some things are too terrible to be true
I wont come here no more if it bothers you
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
Im having a hard time believin some people were ever alive

Im stark naked, but I dont care
Im going off into the woods, Im huntin bare
You dont understand itmy feelings for you
Well, youd be honest with me if only you knew

Im here to create the new imperial empire
Im going to do whatever circumstances require
I care so much for youdidnt think that I could
I cant tell my heart that youre no good

Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You dont understand itmy feelings for you

Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met, cried she
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee

[Verse 2]
I could have married a King's daughter there
She would have married me
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there
It's all for the love of thee

[Verse 3]
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there
I'm sure you're the one to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I'm sure he's a fine young man

[Verse 4]
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me
I'll take you where the green grass grows
On the shores of sunny Italy

[Verse 5]
So up she picked her babies three
And gave them kisses, one, two, three
Saying "take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And keep him good company."

[Verse 6]
Well, they were sailing about two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck
Saying she wants company

[Verse 7]
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home?
Or are you weeping for your babies three?"
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter
I'm weeping for my babies three."

[Verse 8]
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as white as snow
Those are the hill of heaven, my love
You and I'll never know

[Verse 9]
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love
They look as dark as night
Those are the hills of hellfire my love
Where you and I will unite

[Verse 10]
Oh twice around went the gallant ship
I'm sure it was not three
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak

[Chorus]
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one

[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor, she sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 3]
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town

[Verse 4]
Oh tell my baby sister not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun

[Verse 5]
Well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain

[Verse 6]
I'm going back to New Orleans, my race is almost run
I'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun

How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?

[Verse 1]
Well I wandered alone through a desert of stone
And I dreamt of my future wife
My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command
In this version of death called life
My plate and my cup are right straight up
I took a rose from the hand of a child
When I kiss your lips, the honey drips
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 2]
Every day we meet on any old street
And you're in your girlish prime
The short and the tall are coming to the ball
I go there all the time
Behind every tree, there's something to see
The river is wider than a mile
I tried you twice, you can't be nice
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 3]
Here come the nurse with money in her purse
Here come the ladies and men
You push it all in and you've no chance to win
You play 'em on down to the end
I'm laying in the sand getting a sunshine tan
Moving along riding in style
From my toes to my head, you knock me dead
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 4]
I count the years and I shed no tears
I'm blinded to what might have been
Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice
Play me the wild song of the wind
I found hopeless love in the room above
When the sun and the weather were mild
You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

[Verse 5]
All the merry little elves can go hang themselves
My faith is as cold as can be
I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof
If you don't believe me, come see
You think I'm blue, I think so too
In my words, you'll find no guile
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold

Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, My God, they killed them all!
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 2]
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously
I didnt do it, he says, and he throws up his hands
I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leaving, he says, and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
In the hot New Jersey night

[Verse 3]
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson thats just the way things go
If youre black you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

[Verse 4]
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, Wait a minute, boys, this ones not dead
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

[Verse 5]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, Why did you bring him in here for? He is not the guy!
Yes, heres the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 6]
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubins in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradleys still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame
Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think youd like to play ball with the law?
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?
Dont forget that you are white

[Verse 7]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, Im really not sure
Cops said, A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and were talking to your friend Bello
Now you dont want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
Youll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He aint no Gentleman Jim

[Verse 8]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
Its my work, hed say, and I do it for pay
And when its over Id just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

[Verse 9]
All of Rubins cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubins witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

[Verse 10]
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fools hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldnt help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

[Verse 11]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
Thats the story of the Hurricane
But it wont be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time hes done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
<END TEXT>
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all!"
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops
"One of us had better call up the cops."

Well, I ain't got no home I'm just ramblin' round
Just a ramblin' worker, go from town to town
Police make it hard wherever I may go
I ain't got no home in this world anymore

All my brothers and my sisters have stranded on this road
That's a hard ol' dusty road that a million feet have trod
Rich men took our home and they drove us from our door
Man can't feel at home in this world anymore

Well, as I look around me it's funny and plain to see
This wicked cruel world is a funny ol' place to be
The gamblin' man is rich lord, the workin' man is poor
Can't fit his home in this world anymore

[Verse 1]
I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends
Where another mans life might begin
Thats exactly where mine ends
I have tried my hand at bribery
Blackmail and deceit
And Ive served time for everything
Cept beggin' on the street

[Verse 2]
Well, once I was rather prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back
But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame

[Verse 3]
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
Soon I will be gone
But let me just warn you all
Before I do pass on
Stay free from petty jealousies
Live by no mans code
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road

[Verse 1]
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

[Chorus]
I and I
In creation where ones nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

[Verse 2]
Think Ill go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here, nothing ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, shell just want me to talk
I got nothing to say, specially about whatever was

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift dont win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justices beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Outside of two men on a train platform theres nobody in sight
Theyre waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but thats all right
She should still be there sleepin when I get back

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Noontime, and Im still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I cant stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but Im listening only to my heart
Ive made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

[Chorus]
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know Ill make it through
And they, they look at me and frown
Theyd like to drive me from this town
They dont want me around
Because I believe in you

[Verse 2]
They show me to the door
They say dont come back no more
Because I dont be like theyd like me to
And I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I dont feel alone
Because I believe in you

[Verse 3]
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
I believe in you even though we be apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Oh, when the night is disappearing
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart

[Verse 4]
Dont let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which youve given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you

[Verse 5]
I believe in you when winter turn to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldnt make me go back

[Verse 6]
Dont let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I, I dont mind the pain
Dont mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
Because I believe in you

Well i go get broke down, before i bust down
Gotta get in without a broken heart well
Get a hoe down before a low down
Before my guilt is acid hot
Well every single morning
I can't take it no more
Well if you with a heartache
Go down baby
She don't care about that us apart
Well she gonna have 'em, but she won't invite me
But i can't come in with a broken heart
I hold down, can't come down
Is comin' in without a broken heart
Well you cheated, showed her down
But i don't come around
O when she'll take ya tear us apart

Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

And you think you would leave me behind
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart
When I can't get you off of my mind?

Oh, I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

You believe that a true love is blind
So you fool every new love you find
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind

But I can't get you off of my mind
When I try, I'm just wastin' my time
Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

[Verse 1]
I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd you love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so

[Verse 2]
I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes, I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

[Chorus]
I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

[Chorus]
I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep

I couldn't sleep a wink last night
Because we had that silly fight
I thought my heart would break the whole night through
I knew that you'd be sorry
And I'm sorry too

I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night

I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night

[Verse 1]
I can't understand
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
Id sure like to know
Why she'd go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now mornings clear
Its like I ain't here
She acts like we never met

[Verse 2]
Its all new to me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But its hard to think on
That shes the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish shed unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Stead of actin' like we never have met

[Verse 3]
If she ain't feelin' well
Then why dont she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to or chase

Well her skirt it swayed
As the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met

[Verse 4]
If I didnt have to guess
Id gladly confess
To anything I mightve tried
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong
I'd wish shed tell me what it is, Ill run and hide

Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she dont
Evidently she wont
She just acts like we never have met

[Verse 5]
Im leavin' today
Ill be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me
Is it easy to forget?
Ill say, Its easily done
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met!

I don't hurt anymore;
All my teardrops are dry
No more walking the floor
With that burning inside

Just to think it could be;
Time has opened the door
And at last I am free
I don't hurt anymore

Oh, you still deny
I wanted to die
The day taht you said we were through
But now that I find
You're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true

I forgot it somehow
That I cancelled before
And it's wonderful now
I don't hurt anymore

No use to deny
I wanted to die
The day that you said we were through

You're out of my mind

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold

[Verse 2]
Arise, arise, he cried so loud
With a voice without restraint
Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
But go on your way accordingly
But know youre not alone

[Verse 3]
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried

[Verse 1]
Well I'm looking the world over
Looking far off into the East
And I see my baby coming
She's walking with the village priest
I feel a change coming on
And the last part of the day is already gone

[Verse 2]
We got so much in common
We strive for the same old ends
And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 3]
Life is for love
And they say that love is blind
If you want to live easy
Baby pack your clothes with mine
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 4]
Well now what's the use in dreaming
You got better things to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

[Verse 5]
You are as whorish as ever
Baby you could start a fire
I must be losing my mind
You're the object of my desire
I feel a change coming on
And the fourth part of the day is already gone

[Verse 6]
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people they tell me
I got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the money
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose
I feel a change coming on

I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 1]
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 2]
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

[Verse 3]
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be

[Verse 4]
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her

That I'd soon forget we ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met

I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found

Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air

I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he wouldve stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death

[Verse 2]
I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain
Whose heaven is like Ironsides
Whose tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied
Who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me

[Verse 3]
I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass

[Verse 1]
Im just average, common too
Im just like him, and the same as you
Im everybodys brother and son
I ain't different than anyone
Ain't no use a-talk to me
Its just the same as talkin' to you

[Verse 2]
I was shadow boxing early in the day
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
I said Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
26, 27, 28, 29, Im gonna' make your face look just like mine
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay youd better run
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma wont even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen

[Verse 3]
Well, I dont know, but Ive been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold
I ask ya' how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first
Wowee! Pretty scary!

[Verse 4]
Now, Im liberal, but to a degree
I want everybody to be free
But if you think Ill let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think Im crazy!
I wouldnt let him do it for all the farms in Cuba

[Verse 5]
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead
Hes a weird monkey, very funky

[Verse 6]
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waitin' to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was fallin' in my face
But they wouldnt let me on the tennis court

[Verse 7]
I got a woman, shes so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when Im nude
Puts bubblegum in my food
Shes funny, wants my money, calls me honey

[Verse 8]
Now I got a friend who spends his life
Stabbin' my picture with a Bowie knife
Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf
I got a million friends!

[Verse 9]
Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sisters home
Ah got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee! Im a poet, and I know it
Hope I dont blow it

[Verse 10]
Im gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And Im gonna' ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course
Carryin' The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds

[Verse 11]
Now youre probably wonderin' by now
Just what this song is all about
Whats probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for
Its nothin'
Its sumpin' I learned over in England

[Verse 1]
Well, I took me a woman late last night
Is three-fourths drunk, she looked alright
She took off her wheel, took off her onion gook
Took off her wig, said, How do I smell?"
I's high flyin bare-naked
Out the window!

[Verse 2]
Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Dont hurt me none, dont hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
(She's a tryin to hide, pretendin she don't know me)

[Verse 3]
Is out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
(Cost a quarter, half price)

[Verse 4]
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop
Its President Kennedy calling me up
He said, My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?
I said, My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren
(Country'll grow)

[Verse 5]
Well, I got a woman five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head
Rolls me over and kicks me out of bed
(Shes a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser)

[Verse 6]
Oh, there ain't use in me working all the time
I got a woman who works herself blind
Works up to her britches, up to her neck
Writes me letters and sends me checks
(Shes a humdinger
Folk singer)

[Verse 7]
Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill
(I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a string bean
I jumped a TV dinner
I jumped a shotgun)

[Verse 8]
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote
Hes a-running for office on the ballot note
Hes out there preaching in front of the steeple
Tellin me he loves all kinds-a people
(Hes eatin bagels
Hes eatin pizza
Hes eatin chitlins)

[Verse 9]
Oh, set me down on a television floor
Ill flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
(greasy kid stuff
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays, Martin Luther King, Ola Tunji)

[Verse 10]
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow mustache on my face
Shes insane

[Verse 11]
Well, ask me why Im drunk all the time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
I catch dinosaurs
Make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton

[Verse 1]
They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 2]
They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 3]
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears hes not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed

[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
<END TEXT>
I see my light come shinin'
From the West unto the East
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Everythin' is not misplaced
Every distance is not near
Yet I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shinin'
From the West unto the East
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must crawl
But I swear I see my reflection
So high above the wall

I see my light come shinin'
From the West unto the East
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They take a look around and painting
But if it's not the same
Wishing only the heart is breaking
And he swears that he was framed

I see my light come shinin'
All down the West to East
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

[Verse 1: Bob Dylan]
I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool

[Refrain: Bob Dylan]
I threw it all away

[Verse 2: Bob Dylan]
Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had

[Refrain: Bob Dylan]
Until I threw it all away

[Bridge: Bob Dylan]
Love is all there is
It makes the world go round
Love and only love
It cant be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just wont be able to do without it
Take a tip from one whos tried

[Verse 3: Bob Dylan]
So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, dont let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a'hurtin'

[Refrain: Bob Dylan]
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away

[Verse 1]
Well, the rain man comes with his magic wand
And the judge says, Mona cant have no bond
And the walls collide, Mona cries
And the rain man leaves in the wolf mans disguise

[Chorus]
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man
I want to be your lover, baby
I dont want to be hers, I want to be yours

[Verse 2]
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the masked man, Aint you cute!
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
And he says, You aint so bad yourself

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, jumping Judy cant go no higher
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire
Rasputin hes so dignified
He touched the back of her head an he died

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass
Stretching out upon the grass
She gets all messed up and she faints
Thats cause shes so obvious and you aint

<END TEXT>
The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But its not that way
I wasnt born to lose you

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you

(Chorus)

How my fathers, theyve gone down
True love theyve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I dont think about it

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that Im not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And theres nothing she doesnt see
She knows where Id like to be
But it doesnt matter

(Chorus)

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasnt very cute to him, was I?
But I did it, because he lied
And because he took you for a ride
Uh because time was on his side
And because I

[Chorus]
I was young when I left home
But I been out a-rambling around
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

[Verse 1]
It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know

[Verse 2]
Said your mothers dead and gone
Baby sisters all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away

[Verse 3]
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I cant go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord
And I cant go home Thisaway

[Verse 4]
If you miss the train Im on
Count the days Im gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord Lord Lord
And youll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles

[Verse 5]
Im playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On them trestles down by old Jim McKays

[Verse 6]
When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Go home, Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home

[Verse 7]
Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Going to make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind

[Verse 8]
I dont like it in the wind
Want to go back home again
But I cant go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord Lord Lord
And I cant go home Thisaway

Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Think I'll go out and go for a walk
Not much happenin' here, nothin' ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk
I got nothin' to say, 'specially about whatever was

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Outside of two men on a train platform there's nobody in sight
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's all right
She should still be there sleepin' when I get back

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One said to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Noontime, and I'm still pushin' myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put
Someone else is speakin' with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

I and I
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives

Well, your clock is gonna stop
At Saint Peters gate
Ya gonna ask him what time it is
Hes gonna say, Its too late
Hey, hey!
Id sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

Youre gonna start to sweat
And you aint gonna stop
Youre gonna have a nightmare
And never wake up
Hey, hey, hey!
Id sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

Youre gonna cry for pills
And your heads gonna be in a knot
But the pills are gonna cost more
Than what youve got
Hey, hey!
Id sure hate to be you

Youre gonna have to walk naked
Cant ride in no car
Youre gonna let evrybody see
Just what you are
Hey, hey!

Well, the good wines a-flowing
For five cents a quart
Youre gonna look in your moneybags
And find youre one cent short
Hey, hey, hey!

On that dreadful day

Youre gonna yell and scream
Dont anybody care?
Youre gonna hear out a voice say
Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there
Hey, hey!
Id sure hate to be you
On that dreadful day

Let me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me roll it to you
All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to have you in my arms
I'd have you any time

Let me say it, let me play it
Let me lay it on you
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me grow it on you
All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to have you in my arms
I'd have you any time

Let me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart

[Verse 1]
Someones got it in for me, theyre planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish theyd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I cant help it if Im lucky

[Verse 2]
People see me all the time and they just cant remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldnt believe after all these years, you didnt know me better than that
Sweet lady

[Verse 3]
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
Youre an idiot, babe
Its a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 4]
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
I havent known peace and quiet for so long I cant remember what its like
Theres a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didnt know it, you didnt think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars
After losing every battle

[Verse 5]
I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day youll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

[Verse 6]
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
Youre an idiot, babe
Its a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 7]
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasnt enough to change my heart
Now everythings a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
Whats good is bad, whats bad is good, youll find out when you reach the top
Youre on the bottom

[Verse 8]
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I cant remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes
Dont look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
Building burned
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
Springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn

[Verse 9]
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
Youre an idiot, babe
Its a wonder that you still know how to breathe

[Verse 10]
I cant feel you anymore, I cant even touch the books youve read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I was somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory

[Verse 11]
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now Im finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
Youll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And Ill never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

[Verse 12]
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
Were idiots, babe
Its a wonder we can even feed ourselves

If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come
Thats what they explain to me
Just do your thing, youll be king
If dogs run free

[Verse 2]
If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be
To each his own, its all unknown
If dogs run free

[Verse 3]
If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be, and that is all
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall
In harmony with the cosmic sea
True love needs no company
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
If dogs run free

Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gun-belt tight
You'll be asking for trouble
If you're looking for a fight
If you ever go to Houston
Boy, you better walk right

Better know where you're going
Or stay where you are

Say hello to Mary Anne
Say I'm still pulling on the trigger
Hanging on the best I can
If you see her sister Lucy
Say I'm sorry I'm not there
Tell her other sister Betsy
To pray the sinner's prayer

I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Got to keep riding forward
Can't spoil the game
The same way I leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain

Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Hotel

It's just that I ain't got no watch
And you keep askin' me what time it is
So if you got to go, it's all right
But if you got to go, go now

But if you got to go, go now

If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that Im all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that Ive forgotten her, dont tell her it isnt so

[Verse 2]
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

[Verse 3]
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay

[Verse 4]
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And Ive never gotten used to it, Ive just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft

[Verse 5]
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If shes passin back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

[Verse 1]
You will search, babe
At any cost
But how long, babe
Can you search for whats not lost?
Everybody will help you
Some people are very kind
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
Ill keep it with mine

[Verse 2]
I cant help it
If you might think Im odd
If I say Im not loving you for what you are
But for what youre not
Everybody will help you
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
Ill keep it with mine

[Verse 3]
The train leaves
At half past ten
But itll be back tomorrow
Same time again
The conductor hes weary
Hes still stuck on the line
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
Ill keep it with mine

I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen'm
One time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you

You know she don't come
She don't leave me down easy, jell but I don't

Things are crashing down
She's all too tight
In my neighborhood
She cried both day and night
I know it because it was there

It's a milestone
But she's down on her luck
And the day makes her lonely
But to make it hard to buck, now and then

I believe that she'd stop him
If she would start to care
I believe that she'd look upon
His side that used to care
And I'd go by the Lord
Anywhere she's on my way
But I don't belong there

No I don't belong to her
I don't belong to any body
She's my Christ-forsaken angel
But she don't hear me cry
She's a lone-hearted mystic
And she can't carry on
When I'm there, she's all right
But she's not when I'm gone

Heaven knows that the answer
She don't calling no one
She's the way, forsaken beauty
For she's mine, for the one
And I lost her, hesitation
By temptation as it runs
But she don't holler me
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Now I'll cry tonight
Like I cried the night before
And I'm knees on the hassle
But I'll dream about the door
It's so long, she's forsaken
By her faith, worse to tell
It don't have contonation
She smiles, fare thee well

Now when I treat to leave 'er
I was born to love her
But she knows that the kingdom awaits
So high above her
And I run a better race
But it's not too fast still
But I don't perceive her
I'm not there, I'm gone

Well it's all about diffusion
And I cry for her veil
I don't need anybody now
Beside me to tell
And it's all affirmation
I receive but it's not
She's a lone-hearted beauty
But she don't like a spot
And she calls

Yeah, she's gone like the rain
Below the shining yesterday
But now she's home beside me
And I'd like her here to stay
She's a lone, forsaken beauty
And it don't trust anyone
And I wish I was beside her
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Well, it's too hard to stay here
And I don't want to leave
It's so bad, for so few
See, but she's a heart too hard to need
It's alone, it's a crime
The way she mauls me around
But she don't fall to hate me
But tears are gone, a painted clown

Yes, I believe that it's rightful
Oh, I believe it in my mind
I've been told like I said one night before
Carry on the cryin'
And the sole gypsy told her
Like I said, carry on
I wish I was there to help her
But I'm not there, I'm gone
<END TEXT>
It's alright
And then she's all too tight
In my neighbourhood
She cries both day and night
I know it because it was there

It's a milestone
But she down on her luck
And she daily so lonely
But to make hard to buck
I remain

I believe where she's stoppin'
If she wants time to care
I believe that she'd look upon
Deciding to care
And I go by the Lord in a way
She's on my way
But I don't belong there

No I don't belong to her
I don't belong to anybody
She's my prize-forsaken angel
But she don't hear me cry

She's a lone-hearted mystic
And she dain't carry on
When I'm there she's alright
But when she's not when I'm gone

Heaven knows that the answers
She's don't call no one
She's the way, assailin' beautiful
She's mine for the one
And I lost her heavy tension
By temptations does it runs
But she don't holler me
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Now I've cried tonight
Like I cried the night before
And I'm least on the high string
But I dream about the door
It's a long, she's forsaken
By her fate, ways to tell
It don't hang by formation
She's smiled, said thee well

Now went out treat the layway
I was born to love her
But she knows that the kingdom weighs
So high above her
And I run but I race
But it's not too fast to slim
But I don't perceive her
I'm not there, I'm gone

Well it's all about dead years'n
And I cried for her veil
I don't need anybody now
Beside me to tell
And it's all affirmation
I perceive but it's not
She's an old-hearted beauty
But she don't like the spot
And she come

Yes she's gone like the rainbow
The shining yesterday
But now she's warm beside me and
I'd like to hear to stay
She's a unforsaken beauty
And don't trust anyone
And I wish I was beside her
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Well it's a too-hard to stakin'
And I don't far believe
It's all bad for abusing
An' she's hard, too hard to leave
It's unknown, it's a crime
The way she mauls me around
But she told, phoned to hate me
But it's doomed to make a clown

Yes, I believe that it's rightful
Oh I believe it in my mind
I been told like I said when I before
Carry on the grind
And she's all good to tole her
Like I said, carry on
I wish I was there to help her
But I'm not there, I'm gone

Well, it's all right in my head but I can't slumber
And it's too high for me to count I can't get the number
I'm a fool for you, yes I'm a fool for you

But they're all to vain for me all they want is glory
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool for you

I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that the devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again

Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood for love

To be with the one you love
You know when night come, baby God know
You so far away
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood
Baby, I'm in the mood for love
(guitar solo & instrumental)
I said, yes my mother told me
To leave that girl alone
But my mother didn't know
What that girl was puttin' down
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby
I'm in the mood for love
I'm in the mood, in the mood
Baby, I'm in the mood for love

Went out last night just to take a little round
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head

I began to think what a deed I done
I grabbed my head and I began to run
I made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standin on the corner as he's ringin' my bell
Up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
He says, "Young man is your name Brown?
Remember you blowed little Sadie down?"

"Oh, yes sir my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in first degree"
"First degree and second degree
If you got any papers, will you serve them to me."

Well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one for to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail
Oh yes they did

Now the judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years with the ball and stripes, oh no

Went out last night to take a little round
I met my little Sadie and I blowed her down
I run right home and I went to bed
A .44 smokeless under my head

[Verse 1]
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Did they hear when He told Peter, Peter, put up your sword?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?

[Verse 2]
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldnt be seen by men
Saying, Master, tell me why a man must be born again
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?

[Verse 3]
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He said, Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize?
Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?

[Verse 4]
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?

[Verse 5]
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
He said, All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth
Did they know right then and there what the power was worth?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?

[Verse 1]
I was in your presence for an hour or so
Or was it a day? I truly dont know
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low
By that soft and shining sea
Did you respect me for what I did
Or for what I didnt do, or for keeping it hid?
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Of everything you see?

[Chorus]
In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me

[Verse 2]
I got the heart and you got the blood
We cut through iron and we cut through mud
Then came the warning that was before the flood
That set everybody free
Fools they made a mock of sin
Our loyalty they tried to win
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
When they didnt want to know or see

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs
Poverty and shame was theirs
But all that suffering was not to be compared
With the glory that is to be
And Im still carrying the gift you gave
Its a part of me now, its been cherished and saved
Itll be with me unto the grave
And then unto eternity

[Chorus]

Where the sun never shine

In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I will shiver the whole night through

Little girl, Little Girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine

My Husband was a Railroad man
Killed a mile and a half from here
His head, was found, In a drivers wheel
And his body hasn't never been found

Little girl, little girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
You called me weak, and you called me the most
You called rita, bring me back home

[Verse 1]
Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
Ive been burned before and I know the score
So you wont hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 2]
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind
Or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 3]
Well Ive been to the mountain and Ive been in the wind
Ive been in and out of happiness
I have dined with kings, Ive been offered wings
And Ive never been too impressed

[Verse 4]
All right, Ill take a chance, I will fall in love with you
If Im a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?

I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong

I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down

A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said, "Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?"
I said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."

We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."

I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless

How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said

We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said, "There's a body I'm tryin' to find
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price."
'Twas-a then that I knew what he had on his mind

The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on

I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her

She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead

She said, "Where ya been?" I said, "No place special."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes."

Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain

But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong

I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down

A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said, "Are you lookin' for somethin' easy to catch?"
I said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."

We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."

I was thinkin' about turquoise, I was thinkin' about gold
I was thinkin' about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinkin' about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless

How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said

We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said, "There's a body I'm tryin' to find
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price."
'Twas-a then that I knew what he had on his mind

The wind it was howlin' and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hopin' that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on

I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
There was no jewels, no nothin', I felt I'd been had
When I saw that my partner was just bein' friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her

She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead

She said, "Where ya been?" I said, "No place special."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes."

Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzlin' rain

Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
I've been burned before and I know the score
So you won't hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain?

Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind
Or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain?

Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind
I've been in and out of happiness
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings
And I've never been too impressed

All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 1]
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
Im not the one you want, babe
Im not the one you need
You say youre looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me youre looking for, babe

[Verse 2]
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
Im not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say youre looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me youre looking for, babe

[Verse 3]
Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
Theres nothing in here moving
And anyway Im not alone
You say youre lookin' for someone
Wholl pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me youre looking for, babe
<END TEXT>
When you're all alone
All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Ev'ry single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Still the old heart's young enough to say

"It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
"Truly lovely, wasn't it?"
Strings
Ev'ry single lovely day
<END TEXT>
Why do I do just as you say
Why must I just give you your way
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, "I have to wait"
I saw them all, just couldn't fall till we met
It had to be you, it had to be you

I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss but they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you

For nobody else gave me a thrill, with all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you, it had to be you

[Verse 1]
So run here baby, put your little hands in mine
I've got something to tell you
I know you're gonna change your mind
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
I want you, baby, just to understand
I don't wanna be your boss, baby
I just wanna be your man
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
Now when you go home, you don't have to get along
Come back to me, baby
Where I live that's where you belong
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 4]
I love you baby, and you know that it's true
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby
Nothing in this world is like you
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 5]
So run here baby, put your little hands in mine
I've got something to tell you, baby
I know you're gonna change your mind
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
Don't you know, really, don't you know it hurts me too

Well, I ride on a mail train, baby
Cant buy a thrill
Well, I been up all night
Leanin' on the windowsill
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I dont make it
You know my baby will

Dont the moon look good, mama
Shining through the trees?
Dont the brakeman look good, mama
Flaggin' down the Double E?
Dont the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
But dont my gal look fine
When shes comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
Well, I want to be your lover, baby
I dont want to be your boss
Dont say I never warned you
When your train gets lost

[Verse 1]
Talk about me babe, if you must
Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust
I'd do the same thing if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
All good
It's all good

[Verse 2]
Big politician telling lies
Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
It's all good
It's all good

[Verse 3]
Wives are leaving'their husbands, they are beginning to roam
They leave the party and they never get home
I wouldn't change it, even if I could
You know what they say man, it's all good
It's all good
All good

[Verse 4]
Brick by brick, they tear you down
A teacup of water is enough to drown
You ought to know, if they could they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good
Say it's all good

[Verse 5]
People in the country, people on the land
Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe but it's all good
Yeah

[Verse 6]
The widow's cry, the orphan's plea
Everywhere you look, more misery
Come along with me, babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm saying, it's all good
All good
I said it's all good
All good

[Verse 7}
Cold-blooded killer, stalking the town
Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, because it's all good
It's all good
They say it's all good

[Verse 8]
I'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
It's all good
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

[Chorus]
Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

[Chorus]
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

[Chorus]
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

[Chorus]
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
<END TEXT>
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked
An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it
Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only

That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on all around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize and say, "God bless him"

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scuff at pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, "Okay, I have had enough, what else can you show me?"

And if my thought dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only
<END TEXT>
It's funny how ya' loved me
Then forgot so suddenly
It's funny to everyone but me

They told me this would happen
Now they're laughing secretly
It's funny to everyone but me

I should shrug my shoulders and say
Good riddance to a bad affair
But how can I do what my head tells me to
When my heart tells me how much I care

It's funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
It's funny to everyone but me

It's so funny, I still love you
It's the joke of the century
Oh, but it's funny to everyone but me

Well, I ride on the mail train, babe, can't buy a thrill
Well, I've been up all night leanin' on the windowsill
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will

Don't the moon look good, mama, shinin' through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E's?
Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea?
But don't my gal look fine when she's comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost

Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be
Oh, her true love e'er to be

"Oh daughter, oh daughter, your body I will confine
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind
Oh, would ever suit your mind

"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine
Oh, would have this heart of mine

Now Jackie's gone sailing with trouble on his mind
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

"Before you step onboard, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."

"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball

"I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small
But they would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."

The war soon being over, they hunted all around
Among the dead and dying her darling love she found
Oh, her darling love she found

She picked him up all in her arms and carries him to town
And sent for her physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds

This couple, they got married, so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me

Times ain't what they used to be
Oh I tell you people, lord, you can take it from me

Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these
Oh I seen better days and I'm putting up with these
But there's too many people and they're all too hard to please

Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule
Cause I was born in the country, she thinks I'm easy to rule
She tried to hitch me to her wagon, she wants to drive me like a mule

You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent
You know I bought the groceries and I paid the rent
She tried to make me wash her clothes but I got good common sense

I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
I said if you don't want me, why don't you tell me so?
Cause it ain't like a man that ain't got nowhere to go

I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt
I believe I'm giving you sugar for sugar, let you get salt for salt
And if you can't get along with me, well it's your own fault

Now you want me to love you and you treat me mean
How do you want me to love you if you keep a-treating me mean?
You're my daily thought and my nightly dream

Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die
Sometimes I think that you too sweet to die
And another time I think you ought to be buried alive

Well, she's got Jet Pilot eyes from her hips on down
All the bombardiers are trying to force her out of town
She's five feet nine and she carries a monkey wrench
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch
She got all the downtown boys, all at her command
But you've got to watch her closely cause she ain't no woman
She's a man

[Verse 1]
Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang," says he
"And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones."

[Verse 2]
And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Tan gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales

[Verse 3]
Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bravest rankers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay

[Verse 1]
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, Well, he answered
Just because

Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe Crazy, the baby they called Kid Blast
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

[Verse 2]
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof

The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs

The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
Lets blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, Were not those kind of men
Its peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
What time is it? said the judge to Joey when they met
Five to ten, said Joey. The judge says, Thats exactly what you get

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand
What its like to be in society with a shackle on your hand

When they let him out in 71 hed lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, I have returned and now I want whats mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
Im around too many children, hed say, they should never know of one
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, Tell them it was Crazy Joe

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, He is not dead, hes just asleep
Then I saw the old mans limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if Gods in heaven overlooking His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mamas face broke out all in a grin

[Verse 2]
Oh son, you look so fine, Im glad youre a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And well put them on the wall when you come home

[Verse 3]
As that old train pulled out, Johns ma began to shout
Telling everyone in the neighborhood:
Thats my son thats about to go, hes a soldier now, you know
She made well sure her neighbors understood

[Verse 4]
She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war

Oh! Good old-fashioned war!

[Verse 5]
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, Go down and meet the train
Your sons a-coming home from the war

[Verse 6]
She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes

[Verse 7]
Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldnt even recognize his face!

Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face

[Verse 8]
Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away

[Verse 9]
Dont you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home. Acting proud
You wasnt there standing in my shoes

[Verse 10]
Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
Im a-tryin to kill somebody or die tryin
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine

Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

[Verse 11]
And I couldnt help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away

[Verse 12]
As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seeing the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand

[Verse 1]
John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor
He traveled a'with a gun in ev'ry hand
All along this countryside
He opened a'many a door
But he was never known
To hurt an honest man

[Verse 2]
Twas down in Chaynee County
A time they talk about
With his lady by his side
He took a stand
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand

[Verse 3]
All across the telegraph
His name it did resound
But no charge held against him
Could they prove
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down
He was never known
To make a foolish move
<END TEXT>
Johnny Todd he took a notion
For to cross the ocean wide
And he left his love behind him
Walkin' down by the Liverpool tide

For a week she wept full sorrows
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met another sailor
Walkin' down by the Liverpool sands

Why fair maid are you a-weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea?
If you wed with me tomorrow
I'll be by you constantly

I will buy you clothes and blankets
I'll buy you a wedding ring
You shall have a gilded cradle
For to rock you baby in

Johnny Todd came home from sailin'
Sailin' on that ocean wide
And he found his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride

Now, all you men who go a-sailing
For to fight the foreign foe
Never leave, never leave love like Johnny
Marry her before you go

[Verse 1]
Standing on the waters casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

[Verse 2]
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you dont show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Youre a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, youre a dream twister
Youre going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Is nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed couldve carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Well, the riflemans stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, wholl get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes Stepping in

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Its a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
Hell put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you dont show any response

[Chorus]

Well you're coming down High Street, walking in the sun
You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 2]
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know, but I'm going to make you mine
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 3]
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm moving along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm going to grab my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 4]
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

When you're lost in the rain in Juarez, when it's Easter time too
And your gravity falls and negativity don't pull you through
Don't you put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there, and they'll really make a mess outta you

Now if you see Saint Annie, please tell her, "Thanks a lot"
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English, and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon

Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other, though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same

Now all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost

I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough

Yes, I believe that it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Ah, you fake just like a woman
Yes, you do, you make love just like a woman
Yes, you do, then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
<END TEXT>
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That baby's got new clothes

But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe, I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That baby can't be blessed

Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls

She takes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

It was raining from the first
And I was dyin' of thirst, so I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear

That I just don't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet againduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Well, you fake just like a woman
And you take just like a woman
Do you make love just like a woman?
But you break just like a little girl

When you're lost in the rain in Juarez when it's Easter time, too
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill, it's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other, though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you, and man, they expect the same
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost
I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough

Katie's been gone since the spring time
She wrote one time'n sent her love
Katie's been gone for such a long time now
I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of
Dear Katie
If you can hear me
I can't wait to have ya near me
Oh, Katie, since ya caught that bus
Well, I just don't know how things are with us
I'm still here and you're out there
Katie laughed when I said I was lonely
She said, there's no need t'feel that way
Katie said that I was her only one
But then I wonder why she didn't want to stay
Dear Katie, if I'm the only one
How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't ya tell me straight:
How much longer do I have to wait?
I'll believe you
But please come through
I know it's wrong to be apart this long
You should be here, near me
Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind
She's gone to find some newer places
Left the old life far behind
Dear Katie, don't ya miss your home?
I don't see why you had to roam
Dear Katie, since you've been away
I lose a little something every day
I need you here, but you're still out there
Dear Katie, please drop me a line
Just write, love, to tell me you're fine
Oh, Katie, if you can hear me
I just can't wait to have you near me
I can only think
Where are you
What ya do, may be there's someone new

I got the key to the highway, and I'm billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin', cause walkin' is most too slow
I'm goin' down on the border, now where I'm better known
Cause woman you don't do nothin', but drive a good man 'way from home
Now when the moon creeps over the mountain, I'll be on my way
Now I'm gonna walk this old highway, until the break of day
Come here, sweet mama, now and help me with this heavy load
I am due in West Texas, and I've got to get on the road
I'm goin' to West Texas, I'm goin' down behind the farm(?)
I'm gonna ax the good Lord what evil have I done

I got a kind hearted woman
Sure is evil all the time
I got a kind hearted woman

Oh she wants to kill me
Just to have it all of mine

She's got a .32 special
Built on a cross of wood
She's got a .32 special
Built on a cross of wood
I got a .38/20
Man it's twice as good

You're too good to die
Sometimes I'm thinking
You're too good to die
Other times I'm thinking
You oughtta be buried alive

The winter wind is a blowing strong
My hands have got no gloves
I wish to my soul that I could see
The girl I'm a-thinking of

[Verse 1]
Don't you remember me babe
I remember you quite well
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town
With a high sheriff on my trail

[Verse 2]
High sheriff on my trail, boys
High sheriff on my trail
All because I'm falling for
A curly-headed dark-eyed girl

[Verse 3]
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold black hair
And sandy colored skin
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips
When I'm out in the wind
When I'm out in the wind, babe
When I'm out in the wind
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth
When I'm out in the wind

[Verse 4]
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
And tell you everything's alright
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
And not just in the night
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
Who's a-gonna be your man
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand

[Verse 5]
Hold your bad luck hand, babe
Hold your bad luck hand
Who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
And who's a-gonna be your man

[Outro]
The winter wind is a blowing strong
My hands have got no gloves
I wish to my soul I could see
The girl I'm a-thinking of

That long black cloud is coming down
I feel Im knocking on heavens door

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead

[Intro]
I have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called "Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie"

[Verse 1]
When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slamming  and banging
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
"I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born"
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're frying
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's making you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closing with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doing
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinking
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know when they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flying train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve

[Bridge]
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
'Cause you look an' you start getting the chills

[Verse 2]
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you think it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', "Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL"

No but that ain't yer game, it ain't yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital

[Outro]
And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown
<END TEXT>
[Chorus]
Lay down your weary tune, lay down
Lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum

[Verse 1]
Struck by the sounds before the sun
I knew the night had gone
The morning breeze like a bugle blew
Against the drums of dawn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The ocean wild like an organ played
The seaweed's wove its strands
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed
Against the rocks and sands

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I stood unwound beneath the skies
And clouds unbound by laws
The crying rain like a trumpet sang
And asked for no applause

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The last of leaves fell from the trees
And clung to a new love's breast
The branches bare like a banjo played
To the winds that listened best

I gazed down in the river's mirror
And watched its winding strum
The water smooth ran like a hymn
And like a harp did hum

[Chorus]

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs
Let's take a chance, who really cares
Why don't you know, you got nothin' to prove
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs
Why wait any longer, I don't mean too complain?
You can have love but you might lose it
Why run any longer when you're runnin' in vain?
You can have the truth but you got to choose it
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
'Til the break of day, let me see you make him smile
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to hold you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay with you man awhile

[Verse 1]
Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, thats for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirits livin on and on

[Verse 2]
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldnt work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
Hes on some other shore, he didnt wanna live anymore

[Verse 3]
Lenny Bruce is dead but he didnt commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
I rode with him in a taxi once
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone

[Verse 4]
They said that he was sick cause he didnt play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had

Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under somethin' like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, you look so pretty in it, honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, if you wanna see the sun rise, honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you, it's bad for your health, he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead
You know, I don't mind him cheatin' on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you makin' love with him, you forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for
It's your brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat

[Verse 1]
I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: Let it be me

[Verse 2]
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

[Verse 3]
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be ?

[Verse 4]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me
<END TEXT>
I will not go down under the ground
Cause somebody tells me that deaths coming around
An I will not carry myself down to die
When I go to my grave my head will be high
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

Theres been rumors of war and wars that have been
The meaning of life has been lost in the wind
And some people thinking that the end is close by
Stead of learning to live they are learning to die
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

I dont know if Im smart but I think I can see
When someone is pulling the wool over me
And if this war comes and deaths all around
Let me die on this land fore I die underground
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

Theres always been people that have to cause fear
Theyve been talking of the war now for many long years
I have read all their statements and Ive not said a word
But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

Go out in your country where the land meets the sun
See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho
Let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls
And youll die in your footsteps
Before you go down under the ground
<END TEXT>
Let's keep it between us
These people meddlin' in our affairs, they're not our friends
Let's keep it between us
Before doors close and our togetherness comes to an end
They'll turn you against me and me against you 'til we don't know who to trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us
We've been through too much tough times that they never shared
They've had nothing to say to us before
Now all of a sudden it's as if they've always cared
All we need is honesty, a little humility and trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
I know we're not perfect
Then again, neither are they
They act like we got to live for them as if there just ain't no other way
And it's makin' me kind of tired
Can we just lay back for a moment
Before we wake up and find ourselves in a daze that's got us out of our minds?
There must be something we're overlooking here
We better drop down now and get back behind the lines
There's some things not fit for human ears, some things don't need to be discussed
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
They'll tell you one thing and me another
'Til we don't know who to trust
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Let's keep it between us
Before it all snaps and goes too far
If we can't deal with this by ourselves
Tell me we ain't worse off than they think we are
Backseat drivers don't know the feel of the wheel, but they sure know how to make a fuss
Oh, darlin', can we keep it between us?
Can we keep it between us?

[Verse 1]
Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things dont change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon

[Verse 2]
Now, theres a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 3]
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where hes bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars

[Verse 4]
Now, theres a woman on my block
She just sits there facing the hill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 5]
Now, hes hell-bent for destruction, hes afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies

[Verse 6]
But theres a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 7]
You may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn

[Verse 8]
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, hes fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way

[Verse 9]
Now, theres a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 1]
The evening winds are still
I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant
I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 2]
The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go a-stray
I pass the old schoolyard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 3]
Ever since the day
The day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside

[Verse 4]
Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 5]
The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories
My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all a'kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya' know ya' only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya' how to live out on the street
And now youre gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, Do you want to make a deal?"

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya' better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya', ya' can't refuse
When ya' ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya' got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 1]
When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 2]
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 3]
Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 4]
I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and body made him stand
Seeing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west

[Verse 5]
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the west

[Verse 1]
The festival was over, the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 2]
He moved across the mirrored room, Set it up for everyone, he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 3]
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 4]
Big Jim was no ones fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 5]
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
Sorry, darling, that Im late, but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 6]
I know Ive seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebodys shelf
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 7]
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
Shed come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But shed never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 8]
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jims ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 9]
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jims wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 10]
Lily took her dress off, buried it away
Has your luck run out? she laughed at him, Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, theres a brand-new coat of paint
Im glad to see youre still alive, youre looking like a saint
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 11]
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
Theres something funny going on, he said, I can just feel it in the air
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 12]
No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 13]
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, its said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 14]
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink
The hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink
The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 15]
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, Closed for repair
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinking bout her father, who she very rarely saw
Thinking bout Rosemary and thinking about the law
But most of all she was thinking bout the Jack of Hearts

When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West

(And the name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West)

I courted lovely Flora, some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me off my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West

(Then go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West)

'Way down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there, which seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him, it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West

(I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West)

I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and boldly made him stand
Being mad by desperation, I pierced him through the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West

(All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West)

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea;
They placed me in the witness box, and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West

(Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West)

BROKE DOWN ENGINE is a Blind Willie McTell masterpiece. it's about trains, mystery on the railsthe train of love, the train that carried my girl from townThe Southern Pacific, Baltimore & Ohio whateverit's about variations of human longingthe low hum in meters & syllables. it's about dupes of commerce & politics colliding on tracks, not being pushed around by ordinary standards. it's about revival, getting a new lease on life, not just posing therepaint chipped & flaked, mattress bare, single bulb swinging above the bed. it's about Ambiguity, the fortunes of the privileged elite, flood controlwatching the red dawn not bothering to dress. LOVE HENRY is a "traditionalist" ballad. Tom Paley used to do it. a perverse tale. Henry-modern corporate man off some foreign boat, unable to handle his "psychosis" responsible for organizing the Intelligentsia, disarming the people, an infantile sensualistwhite teeth, wide smile, lotza money, kotows to fairy queen exploiters & corrupt religious establishments, career minded, limousine double parked, imposing his will & dishonest garbage in popular magazines. he lays his head on a pillow of down & falls asleep. he shoulda known better. he mustve had a hearing problem. STACK A LEE is Frank Hutchinson's version. what does the song say exactly? it says no man gains immortality thru public acclaim. truth is shadowy. in the pre-postindustrial age, victims of violence were allowed (in fact it was their duty) to be judges over their offendersparents were punished for their children's crimes (we've come a long way since then) the song says that a man's hat is his crown. futurologists would insist it's a matter of taste. they say "let's sleep on it" but theyre already living in the sanitarium. No Rights Without Duty is the name of the game & fame is a trick. playing for time is only horsing around. Stack's in a cell, no wall phone. he is not some egotistical degraded existentialist dionysian idiot, neither does he represent any alternative lifestyle scam (give me a thousand acres of tractable land & all the gang members that exist & you'll see the Authentic alternative lifestyle, the Agrarian one) Billy didn't have an insurance plan, didn't get airsick yet his ghost is more real & genuine than all the dead souls on the boob tubea monumental epic of blunder & misunderstanding, a romance tale without the cupidity. BLOOD IN MY EYES is one of two songs done by the Mississippi Sheiks, a little known de facto group whom in their former glory mustve been something to behold. rebellion against ruin seems to be their strong theme. all their songs are raw to the bone & are faultlessly made for these modern times (the New Dark Ages) nothing effete about the Mississippi Sheiks. WORLD GONE WRONG is also by them & goes against cultural policy. "strange things are happening like never before" strange things alrightstrange things like courage becoming befuddled & nonfundamental. evil charlatans masquerading in pullover vests & tuxedos talking gobbledygook, monstrous pompous superficial pageantry parading down lonely streets on limited access highways. strange things indeedirrationalist bimbos & bozos, the stuff of legend, coming in from left fieldinfamy on the landscape"pray to the Good Lord" hit the light switch! JACK-A-ROE is another Tom Paley ballad (Tom, one of the original New Lost City Ramblers) the young virgin follows her heart (which can't be confined) & in it the secrets of the universe. "there was a wealthy merchant" wealthy & philosophically influential perhaps with an odd penchant for young folk. the song cannot be categorizedis worlds away from reality but "gets inside" reality anyway & strips it of its steel and concrete. inverted symmetry, legally stateless, travelling under a false passport. "before you step on board, sir..." are you any good at what you do? submerge your personality. DELIA is one sad taletwo or more versions mixed into one. the song has no middle range, comes whipping around the corner, seems to be about counterfeit loyalty. Delia herself, no Queen Gertrude, Elizabeth 1, or even Evita Peron, doesnt ride a Harley Davidson across the desert highway, doesnt need a blood change & would never go on a shopping spree. the guy in the courthouse sounds like a pimp in primary colors. he's not interested in mosques on the temple mount, armageddon or world war 111, doesnt put his face in his knees & weep & wears no dunce hat, makes no apology & is doomed to obscurity. does this song have rectitude? you bet. toleration of the unacceptable leads to the last round-up. the singer's not talking from a head full of booze. Jerry Garcia showed me TWO SOLDIERS (Hazel & Alice do it pretty similar) a battle song extraordinaire, some dragoon officer's epaulettes laying liquid in the mud, physical plunge into Limitationville, war dominated by finance (lending money for interest being a nauseating & revolting thing) love is not collateral. hittin' em where they ain't (in the imperfect state that theyre in) America when Mother was the queen of Her heart, before Charlie Chaplin, before the Wild One, before the Children of the Sunbefore the celestial grunge, before the insane world of entertainment exploded in our facesbefore all the ancient & honorable artillery had been taken out of the city, learning to go forward by turning back the clock, stopping the mind from thinking in hours, firing a few random shots at the face of time. RAGGED & DIRTY one of the Willie Browns did thisschmaltz & pickled herring, stuffed cabbage, heavy moral vocabularysweetness & sentiment, house rocking, superior beauty, not just standing therethe seductive magic of the thumbs up salute, carefully thought out overtones & stepping sideways, the idols of human worship paying thru the nose, lords of the illogical in smoking jackets, sufferers from a weak education, pieces of a jigsaw puzzletaking stupid chancesbeing mistreated only just so far. LONE PILGRIM is from an old Doc Watson record. what attracts me to the song is how the lunacy of trying to fool the self is set aside at some given point. salvation & the needs of mankind are prominent & hegemony takes a breathing spell. "my soul flew to mansions on high" what's essentially true is virtual reality. technology to wipe out truth is now available. not everyone can afford it but it's available. when the cost comes down look out! there won't be songs like this anymore. factually there arent any now. by the way, dont be bewildered by the Never Ending Tour chatter. there was a Never Ending Tour but it ended in '91 with the departure of G.E. Smith. that one's long gone but there have been many others since then. The Money Never Runs Out Tour (Australia & West Coast American '92) Principles Of Action Tour (Mexico-South American '92) Outburst Of Consciousness Tour ('92) Dont Let Your Deal Go Down Tour ('93) & others too many to mention each with their own character & design. to know which was which consult the playlists

[Verse 1]
Oh, where is little Maggie
Over yonder she stands
Rifle on her shoulder
Six-shooter in her hand

[Verse 2]
How can I ever stand it
Just to see them two blue eyes
Shining like some diamonds
Like some diamonds in the sky

[Verse 3]
Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine
Than to see you be another man's darling
And to know that you'll never be mine

[Verse 4]
Well, it's march me away to the station
With my suitcase in my hand
Yes, march me away to the station
I'm off to some far-distant land

[Verse 5]
Sometimes I have a nickel
And sometimes I have a dime
Sometimes I have ten dollars
Just to pay for little Maggie's wine

[Verse 6]
Pretty flowers are made for blooming
Pretty stars are made to shine
Pretty girls are made for boy's love
Little Maggie was made for mine

[Verse 7]
Well, yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hand
She's a drinking down her troubles
Over courting some other man

I went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head
I went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head
I began to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and the way I've run
I made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho
Standin' on a corner, ringin' my bell
Up stepped Sheriff from Thomasville
He said, "Young man is you name Brown?
Remember the night that you blowed Little Sadie down"
"Oh yes, Sir, my name is Lee
I murdered Little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and second degree
You got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Took me down town and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they brought me back
I had no one to go my bail
Crammed me back into the county jail
Judge and jury took their stand
Judge had the papers in his hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes

[Verse 1]
Since youve been gone
Ive been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes
Ive been living the blues
Evry night without you

[Verse 2]
I dont have to go far
To know where you are
Strangers all give me the news
Ive been living the blues
Evry night without you

[Verse 3]
I think that its best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride
But I cant deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside

[Verse 4]
If you see me this way
Youd come back and youd stay
Oh, how could you refuse
Ive been living the blues
Evry night without you

I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say:
How sweetly I sleep here alone

The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes

The call of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high

Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Has kindly assisted me home

Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carrol
THE LONESOME DEATH OF HATTIE CARROLL
Bob Dylan
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was
Snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face, now ain't the time for
Your tears
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the
Level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and
Persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Oh, but you who philosophize, disgrace and criticize all
Fears
Bury the rag deep in your face, for now's the time for your
Tears

I held her hand on a cobblestone corner
I kissed her lips by the river bridge
I said goodbye... night train rolling
On a lonesome day, by the lonesome river edge

But that's not the one I was thinking of..
<END TEXT>
I was riding number 9
Heading south from Carolina
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow
Got in trouble, had to roam
Left my girl, left my home
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my baby's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off that Georgia Main
And locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow

All I do is sit and cry
As the evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my head turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

To preach of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost!
A man he did it long ago
And they hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
These things dont happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 2]
The chains of slaves they dragged the ground
With heads and hearts hung low
But it was during Lincolns time
And it was long ago
Long ago, far away
Things like that dont happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 3]
The war guns they went off wild
The whole world bled its blood
Mens bodies floated on the edge
Of oceans made of mud
Long ago, far away
Those kind of things dont happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 4]
One man had much money
One man had not enough to eat
One man he lived just like a king
The other man begged on the street
Long ago, far away
Things like that dont happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 5]
One man died of a knife so sharp
One man died from the bullet of a gun
One man died of a broken heart
To see the lynching of his son
Long ago, far away
Things like that dont happen
No more, nowadays

[Verse 1]
My parents raised me tenderly
I was their only son
My mind got mixed with rambling
When I was all so young
And I left my home the first time
When I was twelve and one
Im a long time a-comin, Maw
An Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 2]
On the western side of Texas
On the Texas plains
I tried to find a job o work
But they said ls young of age
My eyes they burned when I heard
Go home where you belong!
Im a long time a-comin
An Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 3]
I remember when Is rambling
Around with the carnival trains
Different towns, different people
Somehow theyre all the same
I remember childrens faces best
I remember traveling on
Im a long time a-comin
Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 4]
I once loved a fair young maid
An I aint too big to tell
If she broke my heart a single time
She broke it ten or twelve
I walked and talked all by myself
I did not tell no one
Im a long time a-comin, babe
An Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 5]
Many times by the highwayside
I tried to flag a ride
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
Id watch the cars roll by
The empty air hung in my head
Is thinkin all day long
Im a long time a-comin
Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 6]
You might see me on your crossroads
When Im a-passin through
Remember me how you wished to
As Im a-Driftin from your view
I aint got the time to think about it
I got too much to get done
Well, Im a long time coming
An Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 7]
If I cant help somebody
With a word or song
If I cant show somebody
They are traveling wrong
But I know I aint no prophet
An I aint no prophets son
Im just a long time a-comin
An Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 8]
So you can have your beauty
Its skin deep and it only lies
And you can have your youth
Itll rot before your eyes
Just give to me my gravestone
With it clearly carved upon:
Is a long time a-comin
An Ill be a long time gone

[Verse 1]
It's been such a long long time
Since we loved each other when our hearts were true
One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you

Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby
You just may have to go to jail someday

[Verse 2]
Is there a place we can go?
Is there anybody we can see?
Maybe it's the same for you as it is for me

I ain't seen my family in twenty years
That ain't easy to understand, they may be dead by now
I lost track of em after they lost their land

[Verse 3]
Shake it up baby, twist and shout
You know what it's all about
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?
Don't you know, the sun can burn your brains right out

[Verse 4]
My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame, he had an iron heart

[Verse 5]
I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in em that I can't disguise
Come back baby
If I hurt your feelings, I apologize

[Verse 6]
Two trains running side by side, forty miles wide
Down the eastern line
You don't have to go
I just came to you because you're a friend of mine

[Verse 7]
I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It's been a while
Since we walked down that long, long aisle

[Verse 8]
We cried on a cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears
So much for these long and wasted years

[Verse 1]
For his age, hes wise
Hes got his mothers eyes
Theres gladness in his heart
Hes young and hes wild
My only prayer is, if I cant be there
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 2]
As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 3]
The whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I dont ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 4]
Hes young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world thats been raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And cant see another day
Lord, protect my child

[Verse 5]
Therell be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, protect my child

I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
"Just another guy on the lost highway."

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
"Just another guy on the lost highway."

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway

Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway

Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway

"Til the flesh rots off your bones
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return."

"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried

The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And hung on a willow tree."

And light on your right knee
A girl who would murder her own true love
Would kill a little birdlike me."

My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true like ice, like fire
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love, she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Banker's nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
And the night blows rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

[Verse 1]
Im walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

[Verse 2]
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someones distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

Im sick of love but Im in the thick of it
This kind of love Im so sick of it

[Verse 3]
I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them till theyre gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

Im sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; Im lovesick

[Verse 4]
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I feel like Im being plowed under
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

Im sick of love; I wish Id never met you
Im sick of love; Im trying to forget you

[Outro]
Just dont know what to do
Id give anything to be with you

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Verse 3]
I know you havent made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 4]
Id go hungry, Id go black and blue
Id go crawling down the avenue
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You haven't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldnt do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

I am not pleading, or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet

Even though my eyes are hazy
And my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me
Or bring me down with sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
Mama you're just on my mind

[Verse 4]
I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please, understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can't pretend that I don't know
Mama you are on my mind

[Verse 5]
When you wake up in the morning, baby look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago

[Verse 1]
He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
Ah, think Ill call it a bear

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didnt know how
Ah, think Ill call it a cow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they werent too short
It looked like there wasnt nothing that he couldnt pull
Ah, think Ill call it a bull

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasnt too small and he wasnt too big
Ah, think Ill call it a pig

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
Ah, think Ill call it a sheep

He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake

Crickets are chirping, the water is high
Theres a soft cotton dress on the line hangin dry
Window wide open, African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
She gone with the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 2]
Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible hed quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 3]
Preacher was a talkin, theres a sermon he gave
He said every mans conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When its you who must keep it satisfied
It aint easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 4]
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don't live or die, people just float
She went with the man
In the long black coat

[Verse 5]
Theres smoke on the water, its been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man
In the long black coat

Could be the local priest

[Verse 2]
He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands can be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 3]
Well, first hes in the background, then hes in the front
Both eyes are looking like theyre on a rabbit hunt
Nobody can see through him
No, not even the Chief of Police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 4]
Well, he catch you when youre hoping for a glimpse of the sun
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
He could be standing next to you
The person that youd notice least
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 5]
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking
I can tell theres going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 6]
Hes a great humanitarian, hes a great philanthropist
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed
Hell put both his arms around you
You can feel the tender touch of the beast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 7]
Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
Trees thatve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
Want to get married? Do it now
Tomorrow all activity will cease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 8]
Somewhere Mamas weeping for her blue-eyed boy
Shes holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
And hes following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, n how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, n how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before theyre forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 2]
How many years can a mountain exist
Before its washed to the sea?
Yes, n how many years can some people exist
Before theyre allowed to be free?
Yes, n how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesnt see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 3]
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, n how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, n how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

Well, I'll sing you a song, it ain't very long
About an old man, he never done wrong
How he died nobody can say
They found him dead in the street one day
And the crowd, they gathered one fine morn
At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
There on the sidewalk he did lay
They stopped an' stared and they went their way
Well, the policeman come and he looked around
"Get up, old man, or I'm takin' you down"
He jabbed him once with his billy club
The old man then rolled off the curb
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said
"Call the wagon, this man is dead"
The wagon come, they loaded him in
I never saw the man again
Well, I've sung you my song, it ain't very long
About an old man who never done wrong
How he died nobody can say
They found him dead in the street one day

I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised

[Verse 2]
Your mother says that I'm a stranger
A face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore

[Verse 3]
Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain
I'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

I'm a-going back to Colorado
The place that I've started from
If I'd know-ed how bad you'd treat me
Honey, I never would have come

Well I'm sitting in church
In an old wooden chair
I knew nobody
Would look for me there
. . . Sorrow and pity
. . . Rule the earth and the skies
Looking for nothing
Anyone's eyes

Once I had pretty girls
Did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Snowflakes are falling
Around my head
Lord have mercy
It feel heavy like lead
. . . I been hit too hard
. . . Seen too much
Nothing can heal me now
But your touch

Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Loneliness
Got a mind of its own
The more people around
The more you feel alone
. . . I'm chained to the earth
. . . Like a silent slave
Trying to break free
Out of death's dark cave

Once I had a pretty girl
Done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Boys in the street
Beginning to play
Girls like birds
Flying away
. . . I'm carrying the roses
. . . That were given to me
And I'm thinking about paradise
Wondering what it might be

Once I had a pretty girl
She done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Go over to London
Maybe gay Paree
Follow the river
You get to the sea
. . . I was hoping we could drink from
. . . Life's clear streams
I was hoping we could dream
Life's pleasant dreams

Once I had a pretty girl
But she done me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

Well the weak get weaker
And the strong stay strong
The train keeps rolling
All night long
. . . She looked at me
. . . With an irresistible glance
With a smile
That could make all the planets dance

Once I had a pretty girl
She did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

My house is on fire
Burning to the skies
I thought the rain clouds
But the clouds passed by
. . . When I'm gone
. . . You'll remember my name
I'm gonna win my way
To wealth and fame

Once I had a pretty girl
But she did me wrong
Now I'm marching to the city
And the road ain't long

I don't know

[Verse 1]
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love, fare thee well but for a while
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann

[Verse 2]
Ten thousand miles away from home, ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann

[Verse 3]
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high, she'll surely turn to white
If never I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear, Mary Ann

[Verse 4]
If I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great big bowl for two to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you my dear, Mary Ann

Come all you lads of high renown
That would hear of a fair young maiden
And she roved out on a summer's day
For to view the soldiers paradin'
They marched so bold and they looked so gay
Their colors flyin' and the bands did play
And it caused young Mary for to say
"I'll wed you my gallant soldier."

She viewed the soldiers on parade
And as they stood at their leisure
Mary to herself did say
"At last I've found my treasure."
"But oh, how cruel my parents must be
Banishing my true love so far from me
Well I'll leave them all and I'll go with thee
My bold undaunted soldier."

"Oh Mary dear, your parents' love
I pray don't be unruly
For when you're in a foreign land
Believe me you'll rue surely
Perhaps in battle I might fall
From a shot from an angry cannonball
And you so far from your daddy's hall
Be advised by a gallant soldier."

"If I have fifty guineas in bright gold
Likewise a heart that's blunder
And I'd leave them all and I'll go with you
My bold undaunted soldier
So don't say no but let me go
And I will face the daring foe
We'll march together to and fro
I'll wed you my gallant soldier."

And when he saw her loyalty
And Mary so true-hearted
He said, "My darling, married we'll be
And nothin' but death will part us
And when we're in some foreign land
I'll guard you, darling, with my right hand
Hopes that God might stand a friend
To Mary and her gallant soldier."

Come you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

[Verse 1]
Maybe someday youll be satisfied
When youve lost everything youll have nothing left to hide
When youre through running over things like youre walking across the tracks
Maybe youll beg me to take you back
Maybe someday youll find out everybodys somebodys fool
Maybe then youll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool
Maybe someday when youre by yourself alone
Youll know the love that I had for you have been never my own

[Verse 2]
Maybe someday youll have nowhere to turn
Youll look back and wonder bout the bridges you have burned
Youll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And youll see you look much better with me than you do with him
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down
Maybe someday, you will understand
That something for nothing is everybodys plan

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday youll remember what you felt
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
When both of us, baby, we're going through some sort of a test
Neither one of us could do what we do best
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough
Maybe someday, youll believe me when I say
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way

[Verse 4]
Maybe someday youll hear a voice from on high
Saying, For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?
Forgive me, baby, for what I didnt do
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you
Always was a sucker for the right cross
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me

[Verse 5]
Maybe someday therell be nothing to tell
Im just as happy as you, baby, I just cant say it so well
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
Theres no excuse for you to say that we dont think alike
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months
I always like San Francisco, I was there for a party once
Maybe someday youll see that its true
There was no greater love than what I had for you
<END TEXT>
Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this

Someday if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I, stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood

Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I can see is grief and gloom, till the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space

Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free, bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood

Well, that big dumb blonde
With her wheel gorged
Turtle, that friend of hers
With his checks all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk
With his cheese in the cash
They're all gonna be there
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Ev'rybody from right now
To over there and back
The louder they come
The bigger they crack
Come now, sweet cream
Don't forget to flash
We're all gonna meet
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I took my counselor
Out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there
She told him a yarn
Then along came Jones
Emptied the trash
Ev'rybody went down
To that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I'm hittin' it too hard
My stones won't take
I get up in the mornin'
But it's too early to wake
First it's hello, goodbye
Then push and then crash
But we're all gonna make it
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I looked at my watch
I looked at my wrist
I punched myself in the face
With my fist
I took my potatoes
Down to be mashed
And I made it on over
To that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee

[Verse 1]
You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, thats all right mama I told myself one too
Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 2]
You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didnt tell them everything I knew
Well, Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 3]
Im drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 4]
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what its all coming to
Well, Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 5]
Well, I dont dare close my eyes and I dont dare wink
Maybe in the next life Ill be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just dont know who
Well, Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 6]
The last thing you said before you hit the street
Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet
I said, Thats all right mama you  you do what you gotta do
Well, Im trying to get closer. Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 7]
Rock me, pretty baby; rock me till everything gets real
Rock me for a little while; rock me till theres nothing left to feel
And Ill rock you too
Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

[Verse 8]
Well, theres voices in the night trying to be heard
Im sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Yes, Im trying to get closer but Im still a million miles from you

Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it roll ?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?

[Verse 1]
Oh look, he's driving a long, long time
There he still sits on top of the hill
Well aching and jumping with all laid down
With all of them ladies you know he's lonely still
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it roll ?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul ?

[Verse 2]
Well knee deep in number, heavy in toil
Mighty mockingbird he still has such a heavy load
Beneath his boundaries but more if I can tell
With all of these travelling but I'm still on that road
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin ?
Who's gonna let it roll ?

Oh, Lucky's been drivin' a long, long time
And now he's stuck on top of the hill
With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb
And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still

Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load
Beneath his boundaries, what more can I tell
With all of his travelin', but I'm still on that road

[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the shadows with an aching heart
I'm looking at the world tear itself apart
And it's turned to hours, hours turned to days
I'm still loving you in a million ways

[Verse 2]
Well the devil's in the alley, there's a mule kicking in my stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was raised in the country, I've been working in town
I've been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

[Verse 3]
Well I ain't got nothing for you, I had nothing before
Don't even have anything for myself anymore
The sky is full of fire, pain is pouring down
There's nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around

[Verse 4]
Well I got here following the Southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
There's only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 5]
Well I've been loving you too long, I know you ain't no good
Don't make a bit of difference to me, don't see why it should
I was thinking about the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed

[Verse 6]
Well I'm walking through the leaves falling from the trees
I feel like a stranger nobody sees
So many things we never will undo
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too

[Verse 7]
Some people will offer their hand and some won't
Last night I knew ya, tonight I don't
I need something strong to distract my mind
I'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind

[Verse 8]
Well everybody's moving, God knows where
But I'm still here, you're still there
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 9]
Well my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free
I got nothing but affection for those who have sailed with me

[Verse 10]
Winter goes into the summer, summer goes into fall
I look into the mirror, don't see anything at all
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting right about now

[Verse 11]
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
And as tight as the corner that I've painted myself in
I know good fortune is waiting to be kind
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine

[Verse 12]
The emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way
Only one thing that I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape
Were all boxed in, nowhere to escape

[Verse 2]
Citys just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

[Verse 3]
Got nothing' for you, I had nothing' before
Dont even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down
Nothing you can sell me, Ill see you around

[Verse 4]
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 5]
Well, the devils in the alley, mules in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping' in Rosies bed

Everybody moving if they aint already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting' right about now

I'm growing tired of the big city nights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you dear
Nights are dark and dreary everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always along and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome
Miss the Mississippi and you

Memories are bringing happy days of yore
Missing Mississippi and you
Mocking birds are singing around the cabin door
Missing Mississippi and you

Rolling the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore
Miss the Mississippi and you

The seasons they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
To hear again the songbirds sweet melodious tone
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

Well, Im preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
Ill take you cross the river dear
Youve no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like

The clouds are turning crimsonthe leaves fall from the limbs an
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The trailing moss and mystic glow
Purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me

My pulse is running through my palmthe sharp hills are rising from
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Wont you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

[Verse 1]
I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer
I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will

[Verse 2]
I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine

[Verse 3]
Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn

[Verse 1]
Most of the time
Im clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I dont even notice shes gone
Most of the time

[Verse 2]
Most of the time
Its well understood
Most of the time
I wouldnt change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
And I dont even think about her
Most of the time

[Verse 3]
Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
Im strong enough not to hate
I dont build up illusion till it makes me sick
I aint afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Dont even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time

[Verse 4]
Most of the time
She aint even in my mind
I wouldnt know her if I saw her
Shes that far behind
Most of the time
I cant even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was with her

[Verse 5]
Most of the time
Im halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it went
I dont cheat on myself, I dont run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I dont compromise and I dont pretend
I dont even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time

I can survive, I can endure
And I don't even think about her
Most of the time

Most of the time, my head is on straight
Most of the time, I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion 'till it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time

Most of the time, she ain't even in my mind
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind
Most of the time, I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me or if I was with her

Most of the time, I'm halfway content
Most of the time, I know exactly where it all went
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings, that are buried inside
I don't compromise and I don't pretend
I don't even care if I ever see her again

Now, there's some people say your sister might do when your mother is dead
Some people say your sister will do; soon as she married, turn her back on you

You can dig my grave with a bloody spade when I'm dead
You can dig my grave with a bloody spade; see that my digger gets well paid

[Verse 1]
I pounded on a farmhouse
Looking for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired
I'd come a long, long way
I said, Hey, hey, in there
Is there anybody home?
I was standin' on the steps
Feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer
He must've thought that I was nuts
He immediate looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts

[Verse 2]
I fell down
To my bended knees
Saying, I dig farmers
Dont shoot me, please!
He cocked his rifle
And begin to shout
Are you that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about
I said, No! No! No!
Im a doctor and its true
Im a clean-cut kid
And I been to college, too

[Verse 3]
Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had
He said, What do doctors
Know about farms, pray tell?
I said, I's born
At the bottom of a wishing well

[Verse 4]
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldnt lie
He said I guess youre tired
He said it kind of sly
I said, Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove
He said, I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove
Just one condition
You can go to sleep right now
That you dont touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cows

[Verse 5]
I was sleeping like a rat
When I heard something jerkin
There stood Rita
Looking just like Tony Perkins
She said, Would you like to shake a shower?
Ill show you up to the door
I said, Oh, no! no!
Ive been through this movie before
I knew I had to split
But I did not know how
When she said
Would you like to take that shower, now?

[Verse 6]
Well, I couldnt leave
Unless the old man chased me out
Because Id already promised
That Id milk his cows
I had to say somethin'
To strike him very weird
So I yelled out
I like Fidel Castro and his beard
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin', Whats that I heard you say?

[Verse 7]
I said, I like Fidel Castro
I think you heard me right
And I ducked as he swung
At me with all his might
Rita mumbled somethin'
'bout her mother on the hill
As his fist it hit the icebox
He said hes gonna kill me
If I dont get out the door
In two seconds flat
You unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat

[Verse 8]
Well, he threw a Readers Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers
Rita said, Come back!
As he started to load
The sun was coming up
And I was running down the road

[Verse 9]
Well, I dont figure Ill be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel
He still waits for me
Constant, on the sly
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I
Me, I romp and stomping
Thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech
I might be in the swamp

[Verse 1]
I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
Its very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 2]
Theres lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 3]
Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land

[Verse 4]
And when its time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why its so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

I knew a man bojangles and he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
The silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants
That old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high
Then he'd lightly touch down
Mister bojangles
Mister bojangles
Dance
I met him in a cell in new orleans
I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
Laughed and slapped his leg a step
Mister bojangles
Mister bojangles
Dance
He said the name bojangles then he danced a lick
All across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance
Oh he jumped so high and clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh
Shook back his clothes all around
Mister bojangles
Mister bojangles
Dance
Yeah, dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of fifteen years
How his dog 'n him had just travelled all about
His dog up and died, he up and died
And after twenty years he still grieves
Mister bojangles
Mister bojangles
Dance
He said i dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time i spend behind these county bars
Cause i drinks a bit
He shook his head, and then he shook his head
I heard someone ask him: "please"
Mister bojangles
Mister bojangles
Dance

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping

My weariness amazes me
I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering

I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Though you might hear laughing spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And, but for the sky, there are no fences facing

And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
It's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to

I'm glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground

I should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists

Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that

Lou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like "Stardust," he'd turn it down because it would be too late

He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that

Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude

I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group

They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me

The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it

Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs

Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she [inaudible] to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about

Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here

Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. "Big River," "I Walk the Line."

"How high's the water, Mama?" I wrote "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, "How high is the water, mama?" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing

In Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days

Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice

People would say, "What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, "Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs." We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back

GRAMMYS 2015: Complete list | Show highlights | Quotes | Best & worst

The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album
The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album
These songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music

I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone

For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once


If you sang "John Henry" as many times as me -- "John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand."

If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written "How many roads must a man walk down?" too

Big Bill Broonzy had a song called "Key to the Highway." "I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow." I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write

Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose

Welfare Department they wouldnt give him no clothes

He asked poor Howard where can I go

Howard said theres only one place I know

Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Howard just pointed with his gun

And said that way down on Highway 61

You'd have written that too if you'd sang "Key to the Highway" as much as me

"Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away." "I'm sailing away my own true love." "Boots of Spanish Leather" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that

"Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down." If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing "I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more," too
I sang a lot of "come all you" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. "Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail." Or, "Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well."

"Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again." "If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well."

If you sung all these "come all ye" songs all the time, you'd be writing, "Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing."

You'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense

"When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks." Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, "When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through / Dont put on any airs / When youre down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you."

All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary

Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway

Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs

They didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. "Yakety yak, don't talk back." "Charlie Brown is a clown," "Baby I'm a hog for you." Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs, they were better. "This Magic Moment." "Lonely Avenue." Save the Last Dance for Me

Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs

Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few

There were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day

Merle Haggard didn't even think much of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know [inaudible]. Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- "Mama Tried," "The Bottle Let Me Down," "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive." I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing "The Bottle Let Me Down."

"Together Again"? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out

Oh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?

Yep. A more gracious way to lament or "woe is me" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...

What have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction. [Inaudible] doesn't even matter

"Why me, Lord?" I would say that to myself

Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving

After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny

Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do

Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, "Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth." Think about that the next time you [inaudible]

Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about

Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called "Country Road." Tom was going off in this  interview -- "But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that."

Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio

It was called "I Love." I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions
Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing

This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. "Sunday Morning Coming Down."

Well, I woke up Sunday morning

Grammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King
Grammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad

So I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet

Found my cleanest dirty shirt

Then I washed my face and combed my hair

And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall's poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs

You walk into the room

With your pencil in your hand

You see somebody naked

You say, Who is that man?

You try so hard

But you dont understand

Just what you're gonna say

When you get home

You know something is happening here

But you dont know what it is

Do you, Mister Jones?

If "Sunday Morning Coming Down" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didn't hear it

I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record

In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, [inaudible] they've got to look under every stone when it comes to me. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few

But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it

Traditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: "Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues." Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true


The other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio

You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, how do you [inaudible] those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it

Critics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations

"What do you do for a living, man?"

"Oh, I confound expectations."

You're going to get a job, the man says, "What do you do?" "Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, "Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you." Confounding expectations. What does that mean? 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'

The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is "Stand By Me" by the Blackwood Brothers. Not "Stand By Me" the pop song. No. The real "Stand By Me."

The real one goes like this:

When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me

In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me

In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand by me

That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: "Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."

Anyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?

Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. [applause, inaudible]. They're all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices

I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously


He was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don't stand a chance

So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called "Red Hot," and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life

He did it with style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet

I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard "Red Hot." I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day

Yep. A more gracious way to lament or "woe is me" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...

I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was

And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called "Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days." It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying

And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing

I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, "the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise."

Crimson flames tied through my ears, rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I, proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth, "rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Girls' faces formed the forward path from phony jealousy
To memorizing politics of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now
A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school
"Equality," I spoke the word as if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand at the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy in the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms quite clear, no doubt, somehow

From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history

Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school

"Equality," I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach

My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect

Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

The sweetest girl in the world
Is my blue-eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtledoves
While the moon was shining down
I asked her then, I asked her when
Wedding bells would ring
She said, "Oh, dear, it seems so queer
That this could happen here."

You are my little pal
And I never knew a sweeter gal
My little blue-eyed Jane
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Just meet me in the lane
My blue-eyed Jane

Janie dear, listen here
I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you, dear
But now I cannot linger here
I'm going away this very day
Oh please, come go with me
I'll be sad and blue wanting you
Longing all day through

My little blue-eyed Jane
You'll always be the same sweet thing
I know you'll never change
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue-eyed Jane

And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue-eyed Jane
<END TEXT>
The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

[Verse 1]
Well I didn't come here to deal with a dog gone thing
I just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring
There is no way you can put me down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

[Verse 2]
Well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
I can't think of any just now, but I know they exist
I'm sitting in the sun till my skin turns brown
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town

[Verse 3]
She can make you steal, make you rob
Give you the hives, make you lose your job
Make things bad, she can make things worse
She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

[Verse 4]
One of these days, I'll end up on the run
I'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone
I'm going inside, roll the shutters down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

[Verse 5]
Well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget
I still can remember the day we met
I lost my reason long ago
My love for her is all I know

[Verse 6]
State gone broke, the county's dry
Don't be looking at me, with that evil eye
Keep on walking don't be hanging around
I'm telling you again that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town
<END TEXT>
While silent sky keeps birds
You 're going through my eyes
While the water floats Now
I dream about your hair
I think I walk
But I'm not sure
I do not know whether I'm singing
Or when I cry wolf
Whether I'm alive
I do not know
Because you are my golden age
You're my air
<END TEXT>
Well she met him as she promised
Up at Adam's this spring
Expecting some money
Or some other fine thing
No money, no money
To flatter the case
"We'll have to get married
So there'll be no disgrace."
"So jump you up Omie
And away we will ride
To yonder fair country
Where the cool waters glide."
She jumped up behind him
And away they did ride
To yonder fair country
Where the deep waters glide
"Now jump you down Omie
And i'll tell you my mind
My mind is to drown you
And to leave you behind."
She begged and she pleaded
"Oh, don't take my life
And i will deny you
And i'll never be your wife."
There she kicked and he cuffed her
To the worst understand
And he threw her in deep water
That flows through the land
They found her poor body
The following day
The preacher and the reverend
Lord, they all begun to pray
And up spoke her mother
With a voice so a-sting
"Nobody but John Lewis
Could've done such a thing."
They traced him up the waters
To Dutch Charlie's Bend
Where they found him in jail
For killin' a man
"Go hang him, go hang him."
Was that mother's command
"And throw him in deep waters
That flows through the land."

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 2]
Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 3]
Look down angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed her cheek I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 4]
In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 5]
We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed it's hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 6]
This is hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 7]
You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
About a thousand tons, I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today, even one, may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 8]
Can't walk them, baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me, where they belong
I won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 9]
I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
Im still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 10]
Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss away the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 11]
I love women and she loves men
We've been to the west and we going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, "Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 1]
Its been raining in the trenches all day long, dripping down to my clothes
My patience is wearing thin, got a fire inside my nose
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
The truth is I might drown before I find it

[Verse 2]
Well I need a woman, yes I do
Need a woman, yes I do
Someone who can see me as I am
Somebody who just dont give a damn
And I want you to be that woman every night
Be that woman

[Verse 3]
Ive had my eyes on you baby for about five long years
You probably dont know me at all, but I have seen your laughter and tears
Now you dont frighten me, my heart is jumping
And you look like it wouldnt hurt you none to have a man
Who could give you something

[Verse 4]
Well I need a woman, oh dont I
Need a woman, bring it home safe at last
Seen you turn the corner, seen your boot heels spark
Seen you in the daylight, and watched you in the dark
And I want you to be that woman, all right
Be that woman every night

[Verse 5]
Well, if you believe in something long enough you just naturally
Come to think its true
There aint no wall you cant cross over, aint no fire you cant walk through
Well, believing is all right, just dont let the wrong people know what its all about
They might put the evil eye on you, use their hidden powers to try to turn you out

[Outro]
Well I need a woman, just to be my queen
Need a woman, know what I mean?

[Verse 1]
Well, the neighborhood bully, hes just one man
His enemies say hes on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to, no place to run
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 2]
The neighborhood bully just lives to survive
Hes criticized and condemned for being alive
Hes not supposed to fight back, hes supposed to have thick skin
Hes supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 3]
The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
Hes wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
Hes always on trial for just being born
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 4]
Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 5]
Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
That hell live by the rules that the world makes for him
Because theres a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 6]
He got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for, he dont get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he wont be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 7]
Well, hes surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now, they wouldnt hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 8]
Every empire thats enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon
Hes made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody, under no ones command
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 9]
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 10]
Whats anybody indebted to him for?
Nothing, they say. He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
Hes the neighborhood bully

[Verse 11]
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
Running out the clock, time standing still
Neighborhood bully

[Verse 1]
Lost John sitting on a railroad track
Something's out of whack
Blues this morning falling down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trail

[Verse 2]
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive

[Verse 3]
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 4]
The world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell

[Verse 5]
I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the two

[Verse 6]
She says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
You can get wrecked in this dance."
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 7]
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite

[Verse 8]
The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
Lift up your eyes
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice

[Verse 9]
Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
I think the rain has stopped
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

[Verse 10]
The bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day

[Verse 11]
Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart

[Verse 12]
Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
I wish to God that it were night

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes

Now youre here beside me, baby
Youre a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 3]
You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see you
Dont worry, baby, I dont mind leaving
Id just like it to be my idea

[Verse 4]
You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I cant go back to what was, baby
I cant unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I am not going to be the same again

Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break

Never say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Time is all I have to give
You can have it if you choose
With me you can live
Never say goodbye

[Verse 4]
My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground

[Verse 5]
The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand

[Verse 6]
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue
Youll change your last name, too
Youve turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hanging down

Maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Maybe I'll win and maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance
The terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start
Then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Maybe I'll live the life of regret
And maybe I'll give much more than I'll get
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Cant you hear that rooster crowing?
Rabbit running down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

[Verse 2]
Cant you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style
Coming down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

[Bridge]
The night passed away so quickly
It always does when youre with me

[Verse 3]
Cant you feel that sun a-shining?
Ground hog running by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

[Verse 4]
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

Night after night, you wander the streets of my mind
Night after night, don't know what you think you will find
No place to go, nowhere to turn
Everything around you seems to burn, burn, burn
And there's never any mercy in sight, night after night

Night after night
Night after night

Night after night, some new plan to blow up the world
Night after night, another old man kissing some young girl
You look for salvation, you find none
Just another broken heart, another barrel of a gun
Just another stick of dynamite, night after night

Night after night
Night after night

Night after night, you drop dead in your bed
Night after night, another bottle finds a head
Night after night, I think about cutting you loose
But I just can't do it, what would be the use?
So I just keep a-holding you tight, night after night

Night after night after night after night after night
Night after night after night after night after night

Night after night after night after night after night

You're not free to belong to me
And you know I could never be your own
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine
But we're heading for a wall of stone

Warning signs are flashing every where, but we pay no heed
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a picking up speed

No more driver's lash for me
Many thousands gone

[Verse 2]
No more whip lash for me
No more, no more
No more pint of salt for me
Many thousands gone


[Chorus]
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls
Youre a soldier of mercy, youre cold and you curse
He who cannot be trusted must fall

[Verse 2]
Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And theres no time to think

[Verse 3]
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity
In secret, for pieces of change
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange

[Verse 4]
Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think

[Verse 5]
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best
Ive seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed

[Verse 6]
China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And theres no time to think

[Verse 7]
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb
Id have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But thats just the way that I am

[Verse 8]
Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And theres no time to think

[Verse 9]
Anger and jealousys all that he sells us
Hes content when youre under his thumb
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb

[Verse 10]
Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity
You glance through the mirror and theres eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And theres no time to think

[Verse 11]
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer
You cant find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

[Verse 12]
Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility
You know you cant keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But theres no time to think

[Verse 13]
Youve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
Theyre not even sure you exist

[Verse 14]
Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But theres no time to think

[Verse 15]
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair
Starlight in the East and youre finally released
Youre stranded but with nothing to share

[Verse 16]
Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
Neath the moon shining bloody and pink
And theres no time to think

[Verse 17]
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
You can give but you cannot receive

[Verse 18]
No time to choose when the truth must die
No time to lose or say goodbye
No time to prepare for the victim thats there
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to think

When I first received this Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I'm going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.

If I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy died when I was about eighteen and he was twenty-two. From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved  the music I grew up on: country western, rock n' roll, and rhythm and blues. Three separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre. One brand. And Buddy wrote songs  songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative verses. And he sang great  sang in more than a few voices. He was the archetype. Everything I wasn't and wanted to be. I saw him only but once, and that was a few days before he was gone. I had to travel a hundred miles to get to see him play, and I wasn't disappointed.

He was powerful and electrifying and had a commanding presence. I was only six feet away. He was mesmerizing. I watched his face, his hands, the way he tapped his foot, his big black glasses, the eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his guitar, the way he stood, his neat suit. Everything about him. He looked older than twenty-two. Something about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction. Then, out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn't know what. And it gave me the chills.

I think it was a day or two after that that his plane went down. And somebody  somebody I'd never seen before  handed me a Leadbelly record with the song "Cottonfields" on it. And that record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I'd never known. It was like an explosion went off. Like I'd been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times.

It was on a label I'd never heard of with a booklet inside with advertisements for other artists on the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie, string bands. I'd never heard of any of them. But I reckoned if they were on this label with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I needed to hear them. I wanted to know all about it and play that kind of music. I still had a feeling for the music I'd grown up with, but for right now, I forgot about it. Didn't even think about it. For the time being, it was long gone.

I hadn't left home yet, but I couldn't wait to. I wanted to learn this music and meet the people who played it. Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to play those songs. They were different than the radio songs that I'd been listening to all along. They were more vibrant and truthful to life. With radio songs, a performer might get a hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the cards, but that didn't matter in the folk world. Everything was a hit. All you had to do was be well versed and be able to play the melody. Some of these songs were easy, some not. I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads and country blues, but everything else I had to learn from scratch. I was playing for small crowds, sometimes no more than four or five people in a room or on a street corner. You had to have a wide repertoire, and you had to know what to play and when. Some songs were intimate, some you had to shout to be heard.

By listening to all the early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular. You internalize it. You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs, Georgia sea shanties, Appalachian ballads and cowboy songs. You hear all the finer points, and you learn the details.

You know what it's all about. Takin' the pistol out and puttin' it back in your pocket. Whippin' your way through traffic, talkin' in the dark. You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and that Frankie was a good girl. You know that Washington is a bourgeois town and you've heard the deep-pitched voice of John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic sink in a boggy creek. And you're pals with the wild Irish rover and the wild colonial boy. You heard the muffled drums and the fifes that played lowly. You've seen the lusty Lord Donald stick a knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades have been wrapped in white linen.

I had all the vernacular down. I knew the rhetoric. None of it went over my head  the devices, the techniques, the secrets, the mysteries  and I knew all the deserted roads that it traveled on, too. I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew, and I used it.

But I had something else as well. I had principles and sensibilities and an informed view of the world. And I had had that for a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest  typical grammar school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I started composing lyrics. And the themes from those books worked their way into many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental.

Specific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school  I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey.


Moby Dick is a fascinating book, a book that's filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you. The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab  captain of a ship called the Pequod   an egomaniac with a peg leg pursuing his nemesis, the great white whale Moby Dick who took his leg. And he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic around the tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. He pursues the whale around both sides of the earth. It's an abstract goal, nothing concrete or definite. He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil. Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and again. You can anticipate what will happen.

The ship's crew is made up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory, stereotypes. Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses the captains for details about Moby. Have they seen him? There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom. Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker god, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says that to Captain Ahab. Another ship's captain  Captain Boomer  he lost an arm to Moby. But he tolerates that, and he's happy to have survived. He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance.

This book tells how different men react in different ways to the same experience. A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory: Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam, Bildah, Elijah. Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo, Fleece, Starbuck, Stubb, Martha's Vineyard. The Pagans are idol worshippers. Some worship little wax figures, some wooden figures. Some worship fire. The Pequod is the name of an Indian tribe.

Moby Dick is a seafaring tale. One of the men, the narrator, says, "Call me Ishmael." Somebody asks him where he's from, and he says, "It's not down on any map. True places never are." Stubb gives no significance to anything, says everything is predestined. Ishmael's been on a sailing ship his entire life. Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale. He keeps his distance from people.

A typhoon hits the Pequod. Captain Ahab thinks it's a good omen. Starbuck thinks it's a bad omen, considers killing Ahab. As soon as the storm ends, a crewmember falls from the ship's mast and drowns, foreshadowing what's to come. A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually a bloodthirsty businessman, tells Flask, "Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness."

Everything is mixed in. All the myths: the Judeo Christian bible, Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George, Perseus, Hercules  they're all whalers. Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting up a whale. Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge, whale oil  good for coronation of royalty  noble families in the whaling industry. Whale oil is used to anoint the kings. History of the whale, phrenology, classical philosophy, pseudo-scientific theories, justification for discrimination  everything thrown in and none of it hardly rational. Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion, chasing death, the great white whale, white as polar bear, white as a white man, the emperor, the nemesis, the embodiment of evil. The demented captain who actually lost his leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a knife.

We see only the surface of things. We can interpret what lies below any way we see fit. Crewmen walk around on deck listening for mermaids, and sharks and vultures follow the ship. Reading skulls and faces like you read a book. Here's a face. I'll put it in front of you. Read it if you can.

Tashtego says that he died and was reborn. His extra days are a gift. He wasn't saved by Christ, though, he says he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian at that. He parodies the resurrection.

When Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let bygones be bygones, the angry captain snaps back, "Speak not to me of blasphemy, man, I'd strike the sun if it insulted me." Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence. He says, "The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run."  Or these lines, "All visible objects are but pasteboard masks." Quotable poetic phrases that can't be beat.

Finally, Ahab spots Moby, and the harpoons come out. Boats are lowered. Ahab's harpoon has been baptized in blood. Moby attacks Ahab's boat and destroys it. Next day, he sights Moby again. Boats are lowered again. Moby attacks Ahab's boat again. On the third day, another boat goes in. More religious allegory. He has risen. Moby attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod and sinking it. Ahab gets tangled up in the harpoon lines and is thrown out of his boat into a watery grave.

Ishmael survives. He's in the sea floating on a coffin. And that's about it. That's the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs.


All Quiet on the Western Front was another book that did. All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals. You're stuck in a nightmare. Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool of death and pain. You're defending yourself from elimination. You're being wiped off the face of the map. Once upon a time you were an innocent youth with big dreams about being a concert pianist. Once you loved life and the world, and now you're shooting it to pieces.

Day after day, the hornets bite you and worms lap your blood. You're a cornered animal. You don't fit anywhere. The falling rain is monotonous. There's endless assaults, poison gas, nerve gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline, scavenging and scabbing for food, influenza, typhus, dysentery. Life is breaking down all around you, and the shells are whistling. This is the lower region of hell. Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled trenches, rats eating the intestines of dead men, trenches filled with filth and excrement. Someone shouts, "Hey, you there. Stand and fight."

Who knows how long this mess will go on? Warfare has no limits. You're being annihilated, and that leg of yours is bleeding too much. You killed a man yesterday, and you spoke to his corpse. You told him after this is over, you'll spend the rest of your life looking after his family. Who's profiting here? The leaders and the generals gain fame, and many others profit financially. But you're doing the dirty work. One of your comrades says, "Wait a minute, where are you going?" And you say, "Leave me alone, I'll be back in a minute." Then you walk out into the woods of death hunting for a piece of sausage. You can't see how anybody in civilian life has any kind of purpose at all. All their worries, all their desires  you can't comprehend it.

More machine guns rattle, more parts of bodies hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and legs and skulls where butterflies perch on teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out of every pore, lung wounds, wounds too big for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead bodies making retching noises. Death is everywhere. Nothing else is possible. Someone will kill you and use your dead body for target practice. Boots, too. They're your prized possession. But soon they'll be on somebody else's feet.

There's Froggies coming through the trees. Merciless bastards. Your shells are running out. "It's not fair to come at us again so soon," you say. One of your companions is laying in the dirt, and you want to take him to the field hospital. Someone else says, "You might save yourself a trip." "What do you mean?" "Turn him over, you'll see what I mean."

You wait to hear the news. You don't understand why the war isn't over. The army is so strapped for replacement troops that they're drafting young boys who are of little military use, but they're draftin' em anyway because they're running out of men. Sickness and humiliation have broken your heart. You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters, your ministers, and even your own government.

The general with the slowly smoked cigar betrayed you too  turned you into a thug and a murderer. If you could, you'd put a bullet in his face. The commander as well. You fantasize that if you had the money, you'd put up a reward for any man who would take his life by any means necessary. And if he should lose his life by doing that, then let the money go to his heirs. The colonel, too, with his caviar and his coffee  he's another one. Spends all his time in the officers' brothel. You'd like to see him stoned dead too. More Tommies and Johnnies with their whack fo' me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars. You kill twenty of em and twenty more will spring up in their place. It just stinks in your nostrils.

You've come to despise that older generation that sent you out into this madness, into this torture chamber. All around you, your comrades are dying. Dying from abdominal wounds, double amputations, shattered hipbones, and you think, "I'm only twenty years old, but I'm capable of killing anybody. Even my father if he came at me."

Yesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger dog, and somebody shouted, "Don't be a fool." One Froggy is laying gurgling at your feet. You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach, but the man still lives. You know you should finish the job, but you can't. You're on the real iron cross, and a Roman soldier's putting a sponge of vinegar to your lips.

Months pass by. You go home on leave. You can't communicate with your father. He said, "You'd be a coward if you don't enlist." Your mother, too, on your way back out the door, she says, "You be careful of those French girls now." More madness. You fight for a week or a month, and you gain ten yards. And then the next month it gets taken back.

All that culture from a thousand years ago, that philosophy, that wisdom  Plato, Aristotle, Socrates  what happened to it?  It should have prevented this. Your thoughts turn homeward. And once again you're a schoolboy walking through the tall poplar trees. It's a pleasant memory. More bombs dropping on you from blimps. You got to get it together now. You can't even look at anybody for fear of some miscalculable thing that might happen. The common grave. There are no other possibilities.

Then you notice the cherry blossoms, and you see that nature is unaffected by all this. Poplar trees, the red butterflies, the fragile beauty of flowers, the sun  you see how nature is indifferent to it all. All the violence and suffering of all mankind. Nature doesn't even notice it.

You're so alone. Then a piece of shrapnel hits the side of your head and you're dead.
You've been ruled out, crossed out. You've been exterminated. I put this book down and closed it up. I never wanted to read another war novel again, and I never did.

Charlie Poole from North Carolina had a song that connected to all this. It's called "You Ain't Talkin' to Me," and the lyrics go like this:

I saw a sign in a window walking up town one day.
Join the army, see the world is what it had to say.
You'll see exciting places with a jolly crew,
You'll meet interesting people, and learn to kill them too.
Oh you ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talking to me.
I may be crazy and all that, but I got good sense you see.
You ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talkin' to me.
Killin' with a gun don't sound like fun.
You ain't talkin' to me.


The Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into the ballads of a lot of songwriters: "Homeward Bound, "Green, Green Grass of Home," "Home on the Range," and my songs as well.

The Odyssey is a strange, adventurous tale of a grown man trying to get home after fighting in a war. He's on that long journey home, and it's filled with traps and pitfalls. He's cursed to wander. He's always getting carried out to sea, always having close calls. Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat. He angers people he shouldn't. There's troublemakers in his crew. Treachery. His men are turned into pigs and then are turned back into younger, more handsome men. He's always trying to rescue somebody. He's a travelin' man, but he's making a lot of stops.

He's stranded on a desert island. He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them. He meets giants that say, "I'll eat you last." And he escapes from giants. He's trying to get back home, but he's tossed and turned by the winds. Restless winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds. He travels far, and then he gets blown back.

He's always being warned of things to come. Touching things he's told not to. There's two roads to take, and they're both bad. Both hazardous. On one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. He's exhausted. He falls asleep, and he's woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story to strangers. He's been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. It's been a hard road to travel.

In a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you. You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back. And you've had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have. And you too have rambled this country all around. And you've also felt that ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And that's still not all of it.

When he gets back home, things aren't any better. Scoundrels have moved in and are taking advantage of his wife's hospitality. And there's too many of em. And though he's greater than them all and the best at everything  best carpenter, best hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman  his courage won't save him, but his trickery will.

All these stragglers will have to pay for desecrating his palace. He'll disguise himself as a filthy beggar, and a lowly servant kicks him down the steps with arrogance and stupidity. The servant's arrogance revolts him, but he controls his anger. He's one against a hundred, but they'll all fall, even the strongest. He was nobody. And when it's all said and done, when he's home at last, he sits with his wife, and he tells her the stories.

***

So what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, that's all that's important. I don't have to know what a song means. I've written all kinds of things into my songs. And I'm not going to worry about it  what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I don't think he would have worried about it either  what it all means.

John Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived in the time of Shakespeare, wrote these words, "The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts. Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests." I don't know what it means, either. But it sounds good. And you want your songs to sound good.

When Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld  Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory   tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. "I just died, that's all." There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is  a king in the land of the dead  that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place.

That's what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They're meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare's plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, "Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story."

[Intro]
Theres nothing round here I believe in
Cept you, yeah you
And theres nothing to me thats sacred
Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 1]
Youre the one that reaches me
Youre the one that I admire
Every time we meet together
My soul feels like its on fire
Nothing matters to me
And theres nothing I desire
Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 2]
Nothing round here I care to try for
Cept you, yeah you
Got nothing left to live or die for
Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 3]
Theres a hymn I used to hear
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
And theres nothing to remind me of that
Old familiar chime
Cept you, uh huh you

[Verse 4]
Used to play in the cemetery
Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange
But now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something has changed
Im a stranger here and no one sees me
Cept you, yeah you

[Verse 5]
Nothing much matters or seems to please me
Cept you, yeah you
Nothing hypnotizes me
Or holds me in a spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybodys got something to sell
Cept you, yeah you

Come an' gather 'round friends
And I'll tell ya' a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits run a-plenty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty

In the north end of town
My own children are grown
Well I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin'
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him

Well a long winter's wait
From the winda' I watched
My friends they couldn'ta been kinder
And my school it was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner

Oh the years passed again
And the givin' was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason

Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
'Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'

They complained in the East
They're payin' too high
They say that your ore ain't worth a-diggin'
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothin'

So the minin' gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinkin'
When the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was buildin'
'Til one morning's wake
The bed it was bare
And I's left alone with three children

The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'
My children will go
As soon they grow
Well there ain't nothin' here now to hold them

[Verse 1]
Shadows are falling
And Ive been here all day
Its too hot to sleep
And time is running away
Feel like my soul has
Turned into steel
Ive still got the scars
That the sun didnt heal
Theres not even room enough
To be anywhere

[Refrain]
Its not dark yet
But its getting there

[Verse 2]
Well, my sense of humanity
Has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing
Theres been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter
And she wrote it so kind
She put down in writin'
What was in her mind
I just dont see why I should even care

[Refrain]
Its not dark yet
But its getting there

[Verse 3]
Well, Ive been to London
And Ive been to gay Paris
Ive followed the river
And I got to the sea
Ive been down on the bottom
Of a world full of lies
I aint lookin for nothin'
In anyones eyes
Sometimes my burden
Is more than I can bear

[Refrain]
Its not dark yet
But its getting there

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I was born here, and Ill die here
Against my will
I know it looks like Im moving
But Im standing still
Every nerve in my body
Is so vacant and numb
I cant even remember what it was
I came here to get away from
Dont even hear a murmur of a prayer

[Refrain]
Its not dark yet
But its getting there

[Verse 1]
Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you
Not out of spite or anger
But simply because its true
Now, I hope you wont object to this
Giving back all of what you owe
The fewer words you have to waste on this
The sooner you can go

[Chorus]
Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest

[Verse 2]
Nothing was delivered
But I cant say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be
Yes, for telling all those lies
Now you must provide some answers
For what you sell has not been received
And the sooner you come up with them
The sooner you can leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(Now you know)
Nothing was delivered
And its up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made evrybody pay
No, nothing was delivered
Yes, n someone must explain
That as long as it takes to do this
Then thats how long that youll remain

[Chorus]

Nothing is better, nothing is best

The sooner you can leave

Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty rest

Nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made ev'rybody pay
No, nothing was delivered
Yes, 'n' someone must explain
That as long as it takes to do this
Then that's how long that you'll remain

Nothing is better, nothing is best
Take heed of this and get plenty rest

[Verse 1]
O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

[Verse 2]
For Christ is born of Mary
And, gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

[Verse 3]
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him
Still The dear Christ enters in

[Verse 4]
Where children, pure and happy
Pray to the Blessed Child
Where misery cries out to thee
Son of the Mother mild
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks
And Christmas comes once more

[Verse 5]
O Holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today!
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel!

You promised to love me, but what do I see
Just you comin and spilling juice over me
Odds and ends, odds and ends

Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?
We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow

I've travelled all over this world
And now to another I go
And I know I should find good quarters
To wait and welcome Le Beau
Welcome Ol' Roison Le Beau
To welcome Ol' Roison Le Beau
I know how good quarters are waitin'
For to welcome Ol' Roison Le Beau

When I'm dead and laid out on the counter
A voice you will hear from below
Sayin', "Send out a hogshead of whiskey
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau"
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Sayin', "Send out a hogshead of whiskey
To drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau"

Then get you half a dozen smart fellows
Let them all stagger an' go
And dig a great hole in the meadow
And in it put Roison Le Beau
And in it put Roison Le Beau
And in it put Roison Le Beau
Go dig you a hole in the meadow
And in it put Roison Le Beau

And get you a half dozen barrels
Put water at me head and me toes
With a diamond ring scratch in upon it
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau
With a diamond ring scratch in upon it
With the name of Ol' Roison Le Beau

I hear that old tyrant approachin'
That cruel remorseless foe
And I lift up me glass in his honor
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
Take a drink with Ol' Roison Le Beau
And I lift up my glass in his honor

[Verse 1]
On a night like this
So glad you came around
Hold on to me so tight
And heat up some coffee grounds
We got much to talk about
And much to reminisce
It sure is right
On a night like this

[Verse 2]
On a night like this
So glad youve come to stay
Hold on to me, pretty miss
Say youll never go away to stray
Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss
It sure feels right
On a night like this

[Verse 3]
On a night like this
I cant get any sleep
The air is so cold outside
And the snows so deep
Build a fire, throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
On a night like this

[Verse 4]
Put your body next to mine
And keep me company
There is plenty a-room for all
So please dont elbow me

[Verse 5]
Let the four winds blow
Around this old cabin door
If Im not too far off
I think we did this once before
Theres more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss
But it sure feels right
On a night like this

On a little street in Singapore
We'd meet beside a lotus-covered door
A veil of moonlight on her lonely face
How pale the hands that held me in embrace

My sails tonight are filled with perfume of Shalimar
And temple bells will guide me to the shore
And then I'll hold her in my arms and love the way I loved before
On a little street in Singapore
<END TEXT>
Now she's walkin' in the morning
Howlin' you come home
I'll be on my way, so long, forlorn
You just can't go

I will get it if I have to
If I have to please come home
Try, but I'll be dry, and I crave you
If I haunt you back all day

Carry my trouble
Yes you satisfy my mind
I'll try to tell you, if I can't come in
And I must stay true

I'll be happy in the morning
I try my best, I will try to help you
If I can, and I leave it too
But I just can't find you away
Won't some time away

That's the way I think she told mee [??]
Heart she bent on me [??]
I'll be out all morning, for you
But you can't stop me

Yes, I try my best to please you
Try my best, but if I fail
You must help me to see you
As I go by...

Dylan: No, it's twice as slow. Twice as slow. It's too fast
Yeah, but it can go in there, man, but it's just gonna be twice as slow as that
I'll fit the words in, same words, but it's gonna be twice as slow. Play every chord about twice as slow
Dylan: OK. let's try it again

Now, if you send me a letter
I'll be on my way to get it for you
I'll be with my sister too
I can't find me what to do

Yes, I've been trying to get a message
To you, but you have to treat me
I won't let her to
And then I try my best to hunt her, you..

Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time
Very long ago

Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go

Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again

Once upon a time
Never comes again

[The first verse is inaudible]
One man's loss always is another man's gain

Let's take a cherry, I can't make it no more
Can't stop, she's breaking all time on the floor
Better come down easy or don't come down at all
You don't try and to please me, somebody's gonna fall
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

Eight o'clock in the morning, better step aside
Let me be to your warning, you better go by
Three times a loser, number 45
Better not lose her, best stayed alive
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

Wish I'd have found me (??) at the wall
One look at the watch, you better lord at all
You can't stop it or wait it (??) at night
Too hard to keep you waiting, calls me aside
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

On the pillow where you lie
But I dont sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee before I go
To the valley below

Your daddy hes an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
Hell teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

[Chorus]

Your sister sees the future

Your voice is like a meadowlark

Mysterious and dark

One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight Im as lonesome as can be
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me

Oh, its shameful and its sad I lost the only pal I had
I just could not be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rollin' sky
For tonight no light will shine on me

I was so mistaken when I thought that shed be true
I had no idea what a woman in love would do

One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss my darlin' so
I didnt mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

(Verse 1)
I didnt mean to treat you so bad
You shouldnt take it so personal
I didnt mean to make you so sad
You just happened to be there, thats all
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile
I thought that it was well understood
That youd be comin' back in a little while
I didnt know that you were sayin goodbye for good

(Chorus)
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what youre supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

(Verse 2)
I couldnt see what you could show me
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldnt see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didnt realize just what I did hear
I didnt realize how young you were

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
And I couldnt see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldnt see where we were goin'
But you said ya' knew an I took your word
And then ya' told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin me, you werent really from the farm
An I told you, as ya' clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
Yes Im one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And Im one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

Its a restless hungry feeling
That dont mean no one no good
When everything Im a-sayin'
You can say it just as good
Youre right from your side
I'm right from mine
Were both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
There is no friend in sight
I love getting back at night
But I wish I don't

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

This bottle is dried up too
And I'll be all cried up soon
I can't see no God on the moon
It's a long way to go

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby
One for the road

I cry alone at night
He's not alone at night
I'll be there my whole night
But I wish it was whole

One for my baby
One for the road
One for my baby

[Verse 1]
As I was out walking on a corner one day
I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
And I guess hed been there for the whole night or more

[Chorus]
Only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Leaving nobody to carry him home
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

[Verse 2]
A blanket of newspaper covered his head
As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed
One look at his face showed the hard road hed come
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down
To look up on the world from a hole in the ground
To wait for your future like a horse thats gone lame
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?

[Chorus]

A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a mans brain
But he cant be blamed
Hes only a pawn in their game

A South politician preaches to the poor white man
You got more than the blacks, dont complain
Youre better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain
And the Negros name
Is used it is plain
For the politicians gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
Hes only a pawn in their game

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white mans used in the hands of them all like a tool
Hes taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that hes in
But it ain't him to blame
Hes only a pawn in their game

From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And hes taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't a-got no name
But it ain't him to blame
Hes only a pawn in their game

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
Hell see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game

Well, I wake up in the morning
There's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's a-hidin'
Inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearin'
A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?

Well, I go to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask that who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

Well, I ask for something to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta think you're really weird

Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real

Well, there's fist fights in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
Then the mailman comes in
Even he's gotta take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?

Now, theres a certain thing
That I learned from Jim
That hed always make sure Id understand
And that is that theres a certain way
That a man must swim
If he expects to live off
Of the fat of the land
Open the door, Homer
Ive heard it said before
Open the door, Homer
Ive heard it said before
But I aint gonna hear it said no more

[Verse 2]
Now, theres a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
A fellow who always blushes
And that is that everyone
Must always flush out his house
If he doesnt expect to be
Going round housing flushes
Open the door, Homer
Ive heard it said before
Open the door, Homer
Ive heard it said before
But I aint gonna hear it said no more

[Verse 3]
Take care of all your memories
Said my friend, Mick
For you cannot relive them
And remember when youre out there
Trying to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them
Open the door, Homer
Ive heard it said before
Open the door, Homer
Ive heard it said before

I had a hard time waking this morning
I got a lotta things on my mind
Like those friends of yours
They keep bringing me down
Just hangin' round all the time
I've had a hard time waking most mornings
And it's been that way for a month or more
You've had things your way
But now I've got to say
I'm on my way out the door

Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby
You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?

Try and get right, baby, don't you remember how it used to be?

Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby
You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?

You had a hard time waking this morning
And I can see it in your empty eyes
But there's no need for talking
Or walking round the block
Just to figure out the reason why
I have a hard time handing out warnings
I'll just slide on out the door
Cuz I'm tired of everything
Being beautiful, beautiful
And I ain't coming back no more

Why don't you get right, try to get right, baby
You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?

Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon

Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture frame
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like a Jesse James

An' I wish I was on some Australian mountain range
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kind of change

I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carryin' my good luck marked black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin', I just might tell you the truth

[Verse 1]
Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybodys got their heads bowed down
The sun dont shine above the ground
I am a-going down to Oxford Town

[Verse 2]
He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

[Verse 3]
Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door, he couldnt get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?

[Verse 4]
Me, my girl, my girls son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I dont even know why we come
Going back where we come from

[Verse 5]
Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool. The folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you

Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you

Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all

Nothin' else for me to say
And so I'll close. Oh, by the way
Everybody's thinkin' of you
P.S. I love you

I do my best to obey all your wishes
I put a sign up. Think
Now I got to buy us a new set of dishes
Or wash the ones that have piled in the sink

Nothing else to tell you, dear
Except, each day feels like a year
Every night I'm dreamin' of you
P.S. I love you
P.S. I love you

[Chorus]
Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
I shall walk

[Verse 1]
The trail is dusty
And my road it might be rough
But the better roads are waiting
And boys it aint far off

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I walked down by the river
I turned my head up high
I saw that silver linin
That was hanging in the sky

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The evening dusk was rolling
I was walking down the track
There was a one-way wind a-blowin
And it was blowin at my back

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
The gravel road is bumpy
Its a hard road to ride
But theres a clearer road a-waitin
With the cinders on the side

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
That evening train was rolling
The humming of its wheels
My eyes they saw a better day
As I looked across the fields

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
The trail is dusty
The road it might be rough
But the good road is a-waiting
And boys it aint far off

[Verse 1]
Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 2]
Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 3]
Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 4]
Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 5]
How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own

You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away

Well, ya' know that even before I learned her name
Ya' know I loved her just the same
An I tell em all, wherever I may go
Just so theyll know, that she my little lady
And I love her so

[Verse 3]
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
Turned my skies to blue from gray
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

People get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord

People get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers, coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all among those loved the most

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
Oh, there's no hidin' place against the kingdom's throne

So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
Don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith, open the doors and board 'em
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the lord

Bad news, bad news
Come to me where I sleep
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin one of your friends
Is in trouble deep
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Tell me the trouble
Tell once to my ear
Turn, turn, turn again
Joliet prison
And ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 2]
Oh whats the charge
Of how this came to be
Turn, turn, turn again
Manslaughter
In the highest of degrees
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
I sat down and wrote
The best words I could write
Turn, turn, turn again
Explaining to the judge
Id be there on Wednesday night
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 3]
Without a reply
I left by the moon
Turn, turn, turn again
And was in his chambers
By the next afternoon
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Could ya tell me the facts?
I said without fear
Turn, turn, turn again
That a friend of mine
Would get ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 4]
A crash on the highway
Flew the car to a field
Turn, turn, turn again
There was four persons killed
And he was at the wheel
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
But I knew him as good
As Im knowing myself
Turn, turn, turn again
And he wouldnt harm a life
That belonged to someone else
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 5]
The judge spoke
Out of the side of his mouth
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin, The witness who saw
He left little doubt
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
That may be true
Hes got a sentence to serve
Turn, turn, turn again
But ninety-nine years
He just dont deserve
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 6]
Too late, too late
For his case it is sealed
Turn, turn, turn again
His sentence is passed
And it cannot be repealed
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
But he aint no criminal
And his crime it is none
Turn, turn, turn again
What happened to him
Could happen to anyone
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 7]
And at that the judge jerked forward
And his face it did freeze
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin, Could you kindly leave
My office now, please
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Well his eyes looked funny
And I stood up so slow
Turn, turn, turn again
With no other choice
Except for to go
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

[Verse 8]
I walked down the hallway
And I heard his door slam
Turn, turn, turn again
I walked down the courthouse stairs
And I did not understand
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
And I played my guitar
Through the night to the day
Turn, turn, turn again
And the only tune
My guitar could play
Was, Oh the Cruel Rain
And the Wind

My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him

Man says, Freddy! I say, Freddy who? He says, Freddy or not here I come

We live in a political world
Love dont have any place
Were living in times where men commit crimes
And crime dont have a face

[Verse 2]
We live in a political world
Icicles hanging down
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Clouds cover up the ground

[Verse 3]
We live in a political world
Wisdom is thrown into jail
It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up a trail

[Verse 4]
We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank

[Verse 5]
We live in a political world
Where courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
The next day could be your last

[Verse 6]
We live in a political world
The one we can see and can feel
But theres no one to check, its all a stacked deck
We all know for sure that its real

[Verse 7]
We live in a political world
In the cities of lonesome fear
Little by little you turn in the middle
But youre never sure why youre here

[Verse 8]
We live in a political world
Under the microscope
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You always got more than enough rope

[Verse 9]
We live in a political world
Turning and a-thrashing about
As soon as youre awake, youre trained to take
What looks like the easy way out

[Verse 10]
We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all
Its turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall

[Verse 11]
We live in a political world
Everything is hers or his
Climb into the frame and shout Gods name
But youre never sure what it is

A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an, "Oh, beg your pardon"
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words, "Ever after"
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream

You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it?

You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with?

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck"
But you don't mean it

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it?

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem?

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you

You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

[Verse 2]
You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side thats winning

[Verse 3]
You say I let you down
You know its not like that
If youre so hurt
Why then dont you show it?

[Verse 4]
You say you lost your faith
But thats not where its at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

[Verse 5]
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
Youre in with

[Verse 5]
Do you take me for such a fool
To think Id make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What it dont know to begin with

[Verse 6]
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say How are you? Good luck!
But you dont mean it

[Verse 7]
When you know as well as me
Youd rather see me paralyzed
Why dont you just come out once
And scream it

[Verse 8]
No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps Id rob them

[Verse 9]
And now I know youre dissatisfied

[Verse 1]
When I'd ask why the painting was deadly
Nobody could pick up my sign
'Cept for the cook, she was always friendly
But she'd only ask, "What's on your mind?"
She'd say that especially when it was raining
I'd say "Oh, I don't know"
But then she'd press and I'd say, "You see that painting?
Do you think it's been done by Van Gogh?"

[Verse 2]
The cook she said call her Maria
She'd always point for the same boy to come forth
Saying, "He trades cattle, it's his own idea
And he also makes trips to the North
Have you ever seen his naked calf bleed?"
I'd say, "Oh no, why does it show?"
And she'd whisper in my ear that he's a half-breed
And I'd say, "Fine, but can he paint like Van Gogh?"

[Verse 3]
I can't remember his name he never gave it
But I always figured he could go home
Til when he'd gave me his card and said, "Save it"
I could see by his eyes he was alone
But it was sad how his four leaf clover
Drawn on his calling card showed
That it was given back to him a-many times over
And it most definitely was not done by Van Gogh

[Verse 4]
It was either she or the maid just to please me
Though I sensed she could not understand
And she made a thing out of it by saying, "Go easy
He's a straight, but he's a very crooked straight man."
And I'd say, "Does the girl in the calendar doubt it?
And by the way is it Marilyn Monroe?"
But she'd just speak softly and say, "Why you wanna know about it?"
And I'd say, "I was just wondering if she ever sat for Van Gogh."

[Verse 5]
It was either her or the straight man who introduced me
To Jeanette, Camilla's friend
Who later on falsely accused me of stealing her locket and pen
When I said "I don't have the locket"
She said "You steal pictures of everybody's mother I know"
And I said "There's no locket
No picture of any mother I would pocket
Unless it's been done by Van Gogh."

[Verse 6]
Camilla's house stood on the outskirts
How strange to see the chandeliers destroyed
While [?] beneath the velvet carpet
Of fox hunts and love far before

[Verse 1]
Precious angel, under the sun
How was I to know youd be the one
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?

Now theres spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there is no neutral ground
The enemy is subtle, how be it we are so deceived
When the truths in our hearts and we still dont believe?

[Chorus]
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Ya know I just couldnt make it by myself
Im a little too blind to see

[Verse 2]
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, All is well
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them and they wont be able to die?

Sister, let me tell you about a vision I saw
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him about Mohammed
In the same breath
You never mentioned one time the Man who came and died a criminals death

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Precious angel, you believe me when I say
What God has given to us no man can take away
We are covered in blood, girl, you know our forefathers were slaves
Let us hope theyve found mercy in their bone-filled graves

Youre the queen of my flesh, girl, youre my woman, youre my delight
Youre the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night
But theres violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt, through Ethiopia, to the judgment hall of Christ

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

[Verse 2]
Precious father, loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old homes scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

[Verse 3]
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down

Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live a life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name

He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door

Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill

T'was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:

You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief

Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen

Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home

[Intro]
I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found Fenneario

[Verse 1]
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O
What will your mother say to know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?

[Verse 3]
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O
Come a-running down your stairs
Combing back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io

[Verse 4]
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O
The lieutenant he has gone, long gone
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo

[Verse 5]
Well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O
Well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid
He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O

Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
Oh Willie, oh Willie, I'm scared of your ways
I'm scared you will lead my poor body astray

Pretty Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
Well, Polly, Pretty Polly, you guessed just about right
For I dug on your grave the best part of last night

She through her arms around him and she began to cry
She through her arms around him and she began to cry
I can't kill a woman that loves you such as I

There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
He drew out his dagger all in his right hand

He pierced her in the heart and her lifeblood did run
He pierced her in the heart the lifeblood did flow
Deep in her grave Pretty Polly did go

He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
He threw the dirt around her and then he went home
With nobody there but the wild birds to moan

A debt to the devil Willie must pay
A debt to the devil Willie must pay
For killing Pretty Polly and running away

Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
Oh, where is Pretty Polly? Yonder she stands
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand
The rings on the fingers of her lilywhite hand
<END TEXT>
Down in some lone valley
In a sad lonesome place
Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase

Farewell pretty Saro
I bid you Adieu
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go

Well my love she won't have me
So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land

I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold

If I was a poet
And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand

And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I go

[Verse 1]
Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt
Because he has denied himself the things that you cant live without
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through

[Chorus]
Hes the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
Youve got a heart of stone

[Verse 2]
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street
Hope he falls upon himself, oh, wont that be sweet
Because he cant be exploited by superstition anymore
Because he cant be bribed or bought by the things that you adore

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When the whip thats keeping you in line doesnt make him jump
Say hes hard-of-hearing, say that hes a chump
Say hes out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Because he doesnt pay no tribute to the king that you serve

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Say that hes a loser cause he got no common sense
Because he dont increase his worth at someone elses expense
Because hes not afraid of trying, cause he dont look at you and smile
Cause he doesnt tell you jokes or fairy tales, say hes got no style

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last youll go back from where you came
But youve picked up quite a story and youve changed since the womb
What happened to the real you, youve been captured but by whom?

[Chorus]
<END TEXT>
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That youre tired of yourself and all of your creations

Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?
Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you

Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?
Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And youre sick of all this repetition

Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?
Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?

Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic

Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?
Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?

Now when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody ya' dont have to speak to

Wont you come see me, Queen Jane?
Aw, wont you come see me, Queen Jane?

They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck"

[Chorus]
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 4]
Well, they'll stone you and say that that's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar

[Chorus]
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright

[Verse 5]
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they're all brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave

[Chorus]
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned!

[Verse 1]
Im a rambler, Im a gambler
Im a long way from my home
If the people dont like me
They can leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Come sit down beside me
Come sit down right here
Come sit down, love, I want you
Love you boldly, so dear

[Verse 3]
When you get to Wyoming
A letter youll see
If you get into trouble
Just you write and tell me

[Verse 4]
For I once had a lover
Her age was sixteen
Shes a flower of velvet and the rose of Celine

[Verse 5]
Her parents was against me
Now she is the same
If I write on your book, love
Just you blot out my name

[Outro]
Oh theres changes in the ocean
Theres changes in the sea
Theres changes in my true love
There's no change in me

Come around you rovin' gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O' Conley and he gambled all his life
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody knows
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody knows
Sailin' down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They're still talkin' about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
"I've come to win some money," Gamblin' Willie says
When the game finally ended up the whole darn boat was his
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody really knows
Up in the rocky mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody knows
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and the poor
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody knows
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffin' or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody knows
It was late one evenin' during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said, "Willie was to blame"
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody knows
So all you ramblin' gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of this story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man's hand, your gamblin' days are up
And it's ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are gamblin' now
Nobody really knows

[Verse 1]
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youth's early days I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me

[Chorus]
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me

[Verse 2]
They all moved away, said a voice of a stranger
"To that beautiful home by the bright crystal sea"
Some beautiful day I'll meet them in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me

[Chorus]

Who you been lovin' since I've been gone?
A long, tall man with a red coat on
Good for nothin', baby, you doin' me wrong
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?

Who's been playin' around with you?
A real cool cat with eyes of blue
Triflin', baby, are you bein' true?
Who's been foolin' around with you?
Who's been foolin' around with you?

Somebody saw you at the break of day
Dinin' and dancin' on the cabaret
He was long and tall, he had plenty of cash
He had a red Cadillac and a black mustache

He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?

Who's been playin' around with you?
A real cool cat with eyes of blue
Triflin', baby, are you bein' true?
Who's been foolin' around with you?
Who's been foolin' around with you?

Ah, somebody saw you at the break of day
Dinin' and dancin' on the cabaret
He was long and tall, he had plenty of cash
He had a red Cadillac and a black mustache

He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?
Who you been lovin' since I been gone?

[Verse 1]
Some of us turn off the lights and we live
With the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly
Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of them wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 2]
Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life
Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 3]
Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me
Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 4]
Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove
Well, I can't escape from those memories
Of the one that I'll always adore
All those nights, when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 5]
Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I'd tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of a life of crime
And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 6]
Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song
Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once, a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 7]
Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about
Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I had to go back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River Shore

[Verse 8]
Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life
Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
Weve killed each one
And the tables full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says its closin' time
So Ill bid farewell and be down the road

Oh every girl that ever Ive touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever Ive hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends
You need the time to make amends
And stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
Ill bid farewell and be down the line

Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebodys eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
Id only have to stay
So Ill bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, every thought thats strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldnt be sprung
But its not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
Its for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time aint tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It aint quite the end
Ill just bid farewell 'til we meet again

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So Ill make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn

Love is a burning thing
Can change into a firy ring
Bound for wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire
That ring of fire

They say that love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
That ring of fire

Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't my gal look good
When she's comin' after me?

[Verse 1]
Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty, another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 2]
From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the quarrymen
Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I read the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Put on your bags and get 'em packed
Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Slow down you're moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home

[Chorus]

[Verse 8]
Tyger, tyger burning bright
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
In the forests of the night
Cover 'em over and let him sleep

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
Woke up this morning', I must have bet my money wrong

[Verse 2]
I got troubles so hard, I can't stand the strain
I got troubles so hard, I just can't stand the strain
Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains

[Verse 3]
The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the golden light of day
The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the gold light of day
I am not holding nothing' back now, I am not standing' in anybody's way

[Verse 4]
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well, I paid and I paid and my suffering' heart is always on the line

[Verse 5]
Well, I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I ain't nobody's house boy, I ain't nobody's well trained maid

[Verse 6]
I'm flat-out spent, this woman has been driving' me to tears
I'm flat-out spent, this woman she has been driving' me to tears
This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't gonna touch another one for years

[Verse 7]
Well, the warm weather is coming' and the buds are on the vine
The warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine
Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine

[Verse 8]
I got up this morning', saw the rising sun return
Well, I got up this morning', seen the rising sun return
Sooner or later you too shall burn

[Verse 9]
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling' tombs

[Verse 10]
Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end

[Verse 11]
Now I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Ah, I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I woke up this morning, I think I must be traveling' wrong
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape

Sold my guitar to the bakers son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide
But I can get another one
And Ill play for Magdalena as we ride

[Chorus]
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

[Verse 2]
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoof beats like castanets on stone
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon

Was it me that shot him down in the Cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and whats done is done

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In the corrida well sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone
Well drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torren

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
Youll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown

The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, dont say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?

Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night

[Chorus]

I am a rovin' gambler, I've gambled all around
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards
I lay my money down
(I Lay my money down, lay my money down.)

I gambled up in Washington, gambled over in Spain
I'm on my way to Frisco town
To knock down my last game
(knock down my last game; knock down my last game)

I had not been in 'Frisco, many more days than three
I fell in love with a pretty little girl
And she fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me, fell in love with me.)

She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan
She whispered low in her mama's ear
"I love this gamblin' man."
("Love this gamelin' man." "Love this gamblin' man.")

"Daughter, Oh! dear daughter, how could you treat me so?
And leave your dear old mother
And with a gambler go?"
(With a gambler go? with a gambler go?)

"Mother, Oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see my face again
I'll be with the gamblin' man"
(be with the gamblin' man" be with the gamblin' man)

Wrote a letter this mornin'
Put it in your hat
Cause no one to read it
And I know you knew that
I bought a joke, a trick or two
Just to bring and show you
Caught ya with the trickster too
Sometimes I wonder how ya knew
A hypnotist, fancytalker
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor

I knew the man and tried to remember
Just where it was that I'd seen his face
Long ago, in a movie show
He was like that man singin' bass
Knew him by his nurs'ry rhyme:
The story of the rabbit man
Fell right in and said to him:
"i'd like to help you if I can."
I know the film would only shock ya
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor!

He only needed what you had
Asked for nothing more
Said he'd like to take you on
But it's been done before
You couldn't see he's a travelin' man
And he cannot take your hand
It's very hard to understand
Why his songs were never banned
Guess the man would never knock ya
Ruben Remus ain't no doctor!

No one seen ya since he's been gone
It's been a day, maybe more
I took a walk in your yard
And knocked on your back door
Why don't you let me in?
I'm not the man who did ya in
Is Mr. Remus still your friend?
You say you don't remember him
Turn me down, would ya?
Well, I've got news for you
Turn me down would ya
Can't ya tell
I'm gonna change your mind before I'm...
Through...

With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which ya' place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who could they get to carry you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?

(Chorus)

The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And ya' wouldnt know it woulda' happened like this
But a'who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mothers drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do ya' think could resist you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?
They wished youd accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever have persuaded you?

(Chorus)

With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just cant help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, youre on his parole
With your holy medallion an' your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghost-like soul
Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?

(Chorus)

Look who's back in town
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown
All you boys better run for cover
If you don't a-wanna be a broken hearted lover

[Verse 2]
See her in that very tight skirt
Got what it takes
Just to make you hurt
Don't be deceived by those big bright eyes
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doing them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine

I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say
"I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
Please let me love you, baby
Don't put me down"

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My woman needs it everyday
She promised this a-lad shed stay
Shes rolling up a lotta bread to toss away

[Verse 2]
Shes in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Now shes opened up an old maids home
Shes proud, but she needs to roam
Shes gonna write herself a roadside poem about Santa Fe

[Verse 3]
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Since Im never gonna cease to roam
Im never, ever far from home
But Ill build a geodesic dome and sail away

[Verse 4]
Dont feel bad, no, no, no, no, dont feel bad
Its the best food Ive ever had
Makes me feel so glad
That shes cooking in a homemade pad
She never caught a cold so bad when Im away

[Verse 4]
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My shrimp boats in the bay
I wont have my nature this way
And Im leaning on the wheel each day to drift away from

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My sister looks good at home
Shes licking on an ice cream cone
Shes packin her big white comb
What does it weigh?

[Verse 1]
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

[Verse 2]
Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define

[Verse 3]
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

[Verse 4]
Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife

[Verse 5]
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar

[Verse 6]
Sara, Sara
Its all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, Sara
Loving you is the one thing Ill never regret

[Verse 7]
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
Id taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands for you

[Verse 8]
Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel were never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

[Verse 9]
How did I meet you? I dont know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm

[Verse 10]
Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness

[Vere 11]
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door

[Verse 12]
Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Dont ever leave me, dont ever go

I was blinded by the devil
Born already ruined
Stone-cold dead
As I stepped out of the womb
By His grace I have been touched
By His word I have been healed
By His hand I've been delivered
By His spirit I've been sealed

I've been saved

By His truth I can be upright
By His strength I do endure
By His power I've been lifted
In His love I am secure

Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it

Nobody would dare

But by His mercy I've been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long I've been hindered
For so long I've been stalled

I've been saved

By this time Id-a thought I would be sleeping
In a pine box for all eternity
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping

Wherever I am welcome is where Ill be
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection

But to search for love, that aint no more than vanity
As I look around this world all that Im finding

[Verse 1]
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
Theres ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you cant pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, Are you going my way?"
Uncle Tom still working' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill

[Verse 2]
Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissing' his face and putting' prayers on his head
So brave and true, so gentle is he
Ill weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

[Verse 3]
Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours
Theres palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

[Verse 4]
In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good living' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
Theres walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town crying' wont do no good

[Verse 5]
In Scarlet Town, you fight your fathers foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
Youve got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didnt do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
Youll wish to God that you stayed right here

[Verse 6]
Set em Joe, play Walking the Floor"
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
Im staying up late, Im making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
Its all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town

Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask for you
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask for you
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

[Verse 1]
And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground

[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is under the ground

[Verse 3]
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone

[Verse 4]
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And I believe what the father told

And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

I am not going to nowhere fast
Im just glad its over
And Im seeing the real you at last

Well, didnt I risk my neck for you
Didnt I take chances?
Didnt I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?

[Verse 4]
Well, I have had some rotten nights
Didnt think that they would pass
Im just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last

[Verse 5]
Im hungry and Im irritable
And Im tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix

[Verse 6]
Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast
But the time has come
And Im seeing the real you at last

[Verse 7]
When I met you, baby
You didnt show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Starr

[Verse 8]
Well, I dont mind a reasonable amount of trouble
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that Im seeing the real you at last

[Verse 9]
Well, Im going to quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles
I think maybe wed better leave each other alone

[Outro]
Whatever you going to do
Please do it fast
Im still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last
<END TEXT>
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don't
I'd like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won't

From now on I'll be busy
Ain't goin' nowhere fast
I'm just glad it's over
And I'm seeing the real you at last

Well, didn't I risk my neck for you
Didn't I take chances?
Didn't I rise above it all for you
The most unfortunate circumstances?

Well, I have had some rotten nights
Didn't think that they would pass
I'm just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last

I'm hungry and I'm irritable
And I'm tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix

Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast

Well, I'm gonna quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles
I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone

Whatever you gonna do
Please do it fast
I'm still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last

Senor, senor, can you tell me where we're headin'?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Seem like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, senor?

Senor, senor, do you know where she's hidin'?
How long are we gonna be ridin'?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, senor?

There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck
There's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."

Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Can't stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?

Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."

Senor, senor, you know their hearts they're as hard as leather
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, senor

Senor, senor, let's overturn these tables
Disconnect these cables 
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?

Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

I got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that: "All aboard!"

Seven, that's the time we leave - at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back

I never though my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home

One day you turn around and it's summer
Next day you turn around and it's fall
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all?

As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays
'Til a long-forgotten love appears
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years

As I man who has never paused at wishing wells
Now I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years

The golden warm September of my years

[Verse 1]
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where its wounded
And comes to a permanent stop
Wasnt thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific
Just thinking of a series of dreams

[Verse 2]
Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And theres no exit in any direction
Cept the one that you cant see with your eyes
Wasnt making any great connection
Wasnt falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

[Bridge]
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that youre holding
Unless theyre from another world

[Verse 3]
In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasnt looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
Id already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreams

[Verse 1]
Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the Jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck

[Verse 2]
Old Reillys daughter got a message
That her father was going to hang
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand

[Verse 3]
When the judge he saw Reillys daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head
Saying, Gold will never free your father
The price, my dear, is you instead

[Verse 4]
Oh Im as good as dead, cried Reilly
Its only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
Get on your horse and ride away

[Verse 5]
Oh father you will surely die
If I dont take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice
For that reason I will have to stay

[Verse 6]
The gallows shadows shook the evening
In the night a hound dog bayed
In the night the grounds were groaning
In the night the price was paid

[Verse 7]
The next morning she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken
She saw that hangin branch a-bendin
She saw her fathers body broken

[Verse 8]
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him
That two healers will not heal him
That three eyes will not see him

[Verse 9]
That four ears will not hear him
That five walls will not hide him
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him

[Intro]
Seven days, seven more days shell be coming
Ill be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive

[Verse 1]
She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I aint forgotten her eyes
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies

I been good, I been good while I been waiting
Maybe guilty of hesitating, I just been holding on
Seven more days, all thatll be gone

[Chorus]
Theres kissing in the valley
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night thats always brightern the day

[Verse 2]
Seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, shell be coming on forth
My beautiful comrade from the north

[Verse 1]
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
I get the blues for you, baby, when I look up at the sun
Come back here, we can have some real fun

[Verse 2]
Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
Well, it's early in the evening, and everything is still
One more time, I'm walking up on a heartbreak hill

[Chorus 1]
Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
Shake, shake, mama; like a ship going out to sea
You took all my money and you give it to Richard Lee

[Verse 4]
Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking around
Down by the river, Judge Simpson walking a-round
Nothing shocks me more than that old clown

[Verse 5]
Some of you women, you really know your stuff
Some of you women, you really know your stuff
But your clothes are all torn
And your language is a little too rough

[Chorus 2]
Shake, shake, mama; shake it til the break of day
Shake, shake, mama; shake it til the break of day
I'm right here, baby, I'm not that far away

[Verse 7]
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
I'm motherless, fatherless, almost friendless too
It's Friday morning on Franklin Avenue

[Chorus 3]
Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
Shake, shake, mama; raise your voice and pray
If you're goin on home, ya better go the shortest way

She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black

[Verse 2]
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees

[Verse 3]
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She's a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique

Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
And for Christmas get her a drum

'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
I come in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved
Nothing up to that point had even been resolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Suddenly, I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Now the bonds are broken, but they can be retied
Oh, one more journey to the woods to holes where spirits hide
It's a never-ending battle for a peace that's always torn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Well, I've heard newborn babies cryin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man? Is it hopeless and forlorn?
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

And now there's a wall between us, something has been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
And just to think it all began on an uneventful morn'
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on an uneventful morn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence I got repaid with scorn
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm
Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in, she said
I'll give ya shelter from the storm

[Verse 1]
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 2]
Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rolling river
Indians camp along her border
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 3]
Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rolling river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 4]
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rolling river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 5]
For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rolling river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 6]
Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear
I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rolling river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
<END TEXT>
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in

Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
When you get a crazy notion jumpin' all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
An' you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die

I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand
You're takin' all my money and give it to another man

Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die

[Verse 1]
The pawnbroker roared
Also, so, so did the landlord
The scene was so crazy, wasnt it?
Both were so glad
To watch me destroy what I had
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesnt it?
Why didnt you just leave me if you didnt want to stay?
Whyd you have to treat me so bad?
Did it have to be that way?
Now you stand here expectin me to remember something you forgot to say
Yes, and you, I see youre still with her, well
Thats fine cause shes comin on so strange, cant you tell?
Somebody had better explain
Shes got her iron chain
Id do it, but I, I just cant remember how
You talk to her
Shes your lover now

[Verse 2]
I already assumed
That were in the felony room
But I aint a judge, you dont have to be nice to me
But please tell that
To your friend in the cowboy hat
You know he keeps on saying everything twice to me
You know I was straight with you
You know Ive never tried to change you in any way
You know if you didnt want to be with me
That you could, didnt have to stay
Now you stand here sayin you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, cant you reach?
I see you kiss her on the cheek evrytime she gives a speech
With her picture books of the pyramid
And her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)
You better talk to her bout it
Youre her lover now

[Verse 3]
Oh, everybody that cares
Is going up the castle stairs
But Im not up in your castle, honey
Its true, I just cant recall
San Francisco at all
I cant even remember El Paso, uh, honey
You never had to be faithful
I never wanted you to grieve
Oh, why was it so hard for you
If you didnt want to be with me, just to leave?
Now you stand here while your fingers going up my sleeve
An you, just what do you do anyway?
Aint there nothing you can say?
Shell be standing on the bar soon
With a fish head and a harpoon
And a fake beard plastered on her brow
Youd better do something quick
Shes your lover now

[Verse 4]
Oh, why must I fall into this sadness?
Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Do you think I still got what you still got baby?
My voice is really warm
It's just there, it ain't got no form
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby
Ah, your mouth used to be so naked
Your eyes used to be so blue
Your hurts used to be so nameless
And your tears used to be so few
Now your mouth cries wolf
While... (What?)

[Verse 1]
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you

[Verse 2]
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me

[Verse 3]
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by
All good people are praying
Its the last temptation, the last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing

[Verse 4]
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow will be
Another day
Guess its too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away

[Chorus]
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

[Verse 1]
Dont need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Dont need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Dont need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Dont need a shot of whiskey, help me be president

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
I seen the kingdoms of the world and its making me feel afraid
What I got aint painful, its just bound to kill me dead
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I dont need no alibi when Im spending time with you
Ive heard all of them rumors and you have heard them too
Dont show me no picture show or give me no book to read
It dont satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Why would I want to take your life?
Youve only murdered my father, raped his wife
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Dont want to be with nobody tonight
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just aint right
Theres a man that hates me and hes swift, smooth and near
Am I supposed to set back and wait until hes here?

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
What makes the wind want to blow tonight?
Dont even feel like crossing the street and my car aint actin right
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
My conscience is beginning to bother me today

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
If youre a doctor, I need a shot of love

Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said, Now didn't I warn you
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon

Looks like a-nothing but rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street
Hope that it dont sleet

Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me Pa

Now, I try, oh for so awfully long
An' I just try to be
An' now, oh it's a gold mine
But it's free
Yes, but I know in my head
That we're all so misled
And it's that old sign on the cross
That worries me

Now, when I was just a bawlin' lad
I saw what I wanted to be
An' it's all for the sake
Of that I should see
But I was lost on the land
As I heard that front door slam
And that old sign on the cross
Worries me

Well, it's that old sign on the cross
Well, it's that old key to the kingdom
Well, it's that old sign on the cross
Like used to be

But, when I hold my head so high
As I see my old friends go by
An' it's still that sign on the cross
That worries me

Well, it seems to be the sign on the cross
Every day, every night
See the sign on the cross just layin' up on top of the hill
Yes, we thought it might have disappeared long ago
But I'm here to tell you, friends that I'm afraid
It's lyin' there still
Yes, just a little time is all you need, you might say
But I don't know 'bout that any more
Because the bird is here and you might want to enter it
But, of course, the door might be closed
But I just would like to tell you one time
If I don't see you again, that the thing is
That the sign on the cross is the sign you might need the most

Well the sign on the cross
Is just a sign (??) too
Well, there is some in every prison
And there is some in the penitentiary, too
Oh, when your, when your days are numbered
And your nights are long
You might think you're weak
But I mean to say you're strong
Yes you are, if that sign on the cross
If it begins to worry you
Well, that's all right because sing a song
And all your troubles will pass right on through

Silent weekend
My baby she gave it to me
Silent weekend
My baby she gave it to me
She's actin' tough and hardy
But I'm sleepin' at the party
And she's leavin' me down in misery

Silent weekend
My baby she took me by the heart
Silent weekend
My baby she took me by the heart
She's thinkin' about disposin'
But I know I know she's dozin'
And she's tearin' it all apart

Oh lord, I wish monday would come
Silent weekend
Oh lord, I sure wish monday would come
She's uppin' and she's leavin'
But I hate to sit here grievin'
But I just can't sit here playin' dumb

Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin'
'Bout a whole lotta cheatin'
And I, maybe I did please
But I just wallopped a lotta pizza
After makin' our peace
Puts ya down on my bended knees

Silent weekend
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain
Silent weekend
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain
She knows I'm just teasin'
But she's all misbelievin'
And I just don't wanna do it again

[Verse 1]
Christmas makes you feel emotional
It may bring parties or thoughts devotional
Whatever happens or what may be
Here is what Christmas time means to me

[Verse 2]
City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas

[Bridge]
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Verse 3]
City street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures

[Verse 4]
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Don't sing love songs; you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
All men are false, says my mother
They'll tell you wicked, loving lies
The very next evening, they'll court another
Leave you alone to pine and sigh
My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged
Go court another tender maiden
And hope that she will be your wife
For I've been warned and I've decided
To sleep alone all of my life

Stake my future on a hell of a past
Looks like tomorrow is a coming on fast
Ain't complaining about what I got
Seen better times but who has not

Silvio silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come a-knockin' don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone

I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train

Silvio silver and gold

Find out something only dead men know

Give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and further more
When it is time to go you got an open door

I can tell your fancy I can tell your plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain

Silvio silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song

Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong

[Verse 1]
They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

[Verse 2]
They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

[Verse 3]
A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

[Verse 4]
He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

[Verse 5]
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

[Verse 6]
People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate

[Verse 1]
Was in the summer
One early fall
Just tryin' to find my
Little all and all
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2]
Was in the spring
One summer's day
Just when she left me
She gone to stay
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3]
Now don't come running
Holding up your hand
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 4]
Happen for days
Didn't know your name
Oh, why should I worry
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 5]
Went to the station
Down in the yard
Gonna get me a freight train
Work's done got hard
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 6]
The lonesome days
They have gone by
Why should I beg you?
You said good-bye
Now she's gone
An' I don't worry
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1]
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents
See my hound dog bite a rabbit
And my footballs sitting on a barbed-wire fence

[Verse 2]
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet dont walk so fast
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet dont walk so fast
Well, this Arabian doctor came in, gave me a shot
But wouldnt tell me if what I had would last

[Verse 3]
Well, this woman Ive got, shes filling me with her drive
Yes, this woman Ive got, shes thrilling me with her hive
Shes calling me Stan
Or else she calls me Mister Clive

[Verse 4]
Of course, youre gonna think this song is a riff
I know youre gonna think this song is a cliff
Unless youve been inside a tunnel
And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
Cant help but wonder whats happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found
Have they counted the cost itll take to bring down
All their earthly principles theyre going to have to abandon?
Theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 2]
I had a woman down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic
Theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 3]
All that foreign oil controlling American soil
Look around you, its just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walking around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding Americas future from Amsterdam and to Paris
And theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 4]
Mans ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they dont apply no more
You cant rely no more to be standing around waiting
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turning over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 5]
Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All nonbelievers and men stealers talking in the name of religion
And theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 6]
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
Theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 7]
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it
I dont care about the economy
I dont care about astronomy
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
Theres a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
<END TEXT>
[Chorus]
Well, Im hanging on to a solid rock
Made before the foundation of the world
And I wont let go, and I cant let go, wont let go
And I cant let go, wont let go and I cant let go no more

[Verse 1]
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
Nations are angry, cursed are some
People are expecting a false peace to come

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Its the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun
And He never give up til the battles lost or won

[Chorus]

Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you knew, you know even then
That somehow you'll see her again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

Once that you found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go

I don't care what you do, don't care what you say
Don't care where you go, or how long you stay
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with self-doubt
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You made me eat a ton of dust
You're potentially dangerous and not worthy of trust
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

Little by little, bit by bit
Every day I'm becomin' more of a hypocrite
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You've got my mind tied up in knots
I just keep recyclin' the same old thoughts
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

When I heard you was cold, I bought you a coat and hat
I think you must have forgotten 'bout that
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

Gonna blow out your mind and make it pure
I've taken about as much of this as I can endure
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You put me down from a haver creak
That's all right, to you i turn the other cheek
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

You say you need me, how would I know?
You say you love me, but it can't be so
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

I don't wanna brag, but I'll wring your neck
When all else fails, I'll make it a matter of self-respect
Someday baby, you ain't gonna worry po' me any more

Livin' this way ain't a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you?

[Verse 1]
They say, Eat, drink and be merry
Take the bull by the horns
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
Everything looks a little far away to me

[Verse 2]
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap
Too much information about nothing
Too much educated rap
Its just like you told me, just like you said it would be

[Verse 3]
The moon rising like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

[Chorus]
Someones got a hold of my heart
Someones got a hold of my heart
Someones got a hold of my heart
You
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

[Verse 4]
Just got back from a city of flaming red skies
Everybody thinks with their stomach
Theres plenty of spies
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear

[Verse 5]
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said, Be easy, baby, aint nothin worth stealing here

[Verse 6]
Youre the one Ive been waiting for
Youre the one I desire
But you must first realize
Im not another man for hire

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
Hear that hot-blooded singer
On the bandstand croon
September song, Memphis in June
While theyre beating the devil out of a guy whos wearing a powder blue wig

[Verse 8]
I been to Babylon
I gotta confess
I could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Something that crossed over from another century?

[Verse 2]
Thought Id shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walk-in the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Dont have to look no further, youre the soul of many things
I could say that Id be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

[Verse 4]
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now Im in some better place
My hands on the sabre and youve picked up the baton
Something there is about you that I cant quite put my finger on
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Something is the matter, baby, theres smoke in your hair
Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?

[Verse 2]
Youve been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
The truth that Im seeking is in your missing file
Whats your position, baby, whats going on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

[Verse 3]
I know everything about this place, or so it seems
Am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
Whats happening, baby, to make you act so strange?

[Verse 4]
Something is burning, baby, heres what I say
Even the bloodhounds of London couldnt find you today
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue
Who is he, baby, and whats he to you?

[Verse 5]
Weve reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?

[Verse 6]
I can feel it in the night when I think of you
I can feel it in the light and its got to be true
You cant live by bread alone, you wont be satisfied
You cant roll away the stone if your hands are tied

[Verse 7]
Got to start someplace, baby, can you explain?
Please dont fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train
Answer me, baby, a casual look will do
Just what in the world has come over you?

[Verse 8]
I can feel it in the wind and its upside down
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town
Ive had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
I dont want to see you bleed, I know what you need but it is not what you deserve

[Verse 9]
Something is burning, baby, somethings in flames
Theres a man going around calling names
Ring down when youre ready, baby, Im waiting for you
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do
<END TEXT>
I used to walk with you
Along the avenue
Our hearts were carefree and gay
How could I know I'd lose you
Somewhere along the way?

The friends we used to know
Would always smile "Hello"
No love like our love they'd say
Then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way

I should forget
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything
You're gone and yet
There's still a feeling deep inside
That you will always be part of me

So now I look for you
Along the avenue
And as I wander I pray
That some day soon I'll find you
Somewhere along the way

[Verse 1]
Im out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
Im seeing your world of people and things
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
About a funny old world thats a-coming along
Seems sick and its hungry, its tired and its torn
It looks like its a-dying and its hardly been born

[Verse 3]
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that Im a-saying an a-many times more
Im a-singing you the song, but I cant sing enough
Because theres not many men that done the things that youve done

[Verse 4]
Heres to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that traveled with you
Heres to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind

[Verse 5]
Im a-leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that Id want to do
Is to say Ive been hitting some hard traveling too
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

[Verse 2]
A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

[Verse 3]
My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

[Verse 4]
Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in mink
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen

[Verse 5]
They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They lie and dine in their blood
Two-timing slim
Who's ever heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

[Verse 6]
It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you

[Verse 1]
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat
Your temperature is too hot for taming
Your flaming feet are burning up the street
I'm homeless, come and take me
To the reach of your rattlin' drums
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms

[Verse 2]
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing
And your flashing diamond teeth
The night is pitch black, come an make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, Im nearly drowning
If its you my lifelines trace

[Verse 3]
I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms Im riding
I know Im around you but I dont know where
You have slayed me, you have made me
I got to laugh half ways off my heels
I got to know, babe, yeah will you surround me?
So I can know if Im really real
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Broke my heart, lost my soul
Adios, mi corazon
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spring
It was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Well, I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I'm all alone
Mi amor, mi Cora sole

[Verse 2]
Haven't seen her since that night
I can't cross the line you know
They want me for a gambling fight
Like as not it's better so
Still I always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi Corazon
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, mi Corazon
Adios, mi Corazon
Adios, mi Corazon

[Verse 1]
Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can't hardly sleep

[Verse 2]
I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away

[Verse 3]
I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends

[Verse 4]
When you are near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me

[Verse 5]
Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain

[Verse 6]
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love

[Verse 7]
Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea

[Verse 8]
Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night

[Verse 9]
When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay

[Verse 10]
They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down

[Verse 11]
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them

[Verse 12]
I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me

[Verse 13]
I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind

[Verse 14]
Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind

[Verse 15]
I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me

[Verse 16]
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can

[Verse 17]
I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back till fall

[Verse 18]
High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two

[Verse 19]
I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there

[Verse 20]
You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time

Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight
All about that John B. Stetson hat

Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room, and he called for a glass of beer
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doin' here?"
"Waitin' for a train, please bring my woman home

Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."

Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Taking him to the cemetery, buy they failed to bring him back
All about that John B. Stetson hat

[Verse 8]
Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark
It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail

[Verse 9]
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail

[Verse 10]
Well they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail
All about that John B. Stetson hat

Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep."

Now, deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did
Gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
Since that day he ain't been the same
See, the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
He got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again
I've got fire water right on my breath
The doctor warned me I might catch a death
Said, "You can make it in your disguise
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes"

[Verse 1]
I'm walking through the summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
I got nothing to go back to now

[Verse 2]
The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I'm strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will anytime soon

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Under the midnight moon

[Verse 3]
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say, but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been riding a midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Suffering like a fool

[Verse 4]
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, youll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they're ringing for
I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
In the dark land of the sun

[Verse 5]
I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Blues wrapped around my head

Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend my lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside the garden wall, when stars were bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale told his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart, it will always remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain
<END TEXT>
Should my heart not be humble
Should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble
On the way, stay with me
Like the lamb that in springtime
Wanders far from the fold
Comes the darkness and the frost
I get lost, I grow cold
I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind
And though I grope and I blunder and I'm weak and I'm wrong
Though the road buckles under where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder every path leads to thee
All that I can do is pray, stay with me
Stay with me

I'm stealin', I'm stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me
Well I'm stealin' back to my good old used to be

Well the woman I love she's about my size
She's a married woman, come to see me sometime

If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama won't you tell on me

Stay with me baby like my easy rider done

If you don't think I love you, look what a fool I've been

Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 3]
Front door shut, back door too
Blinds pulled down, what' cha gonna do?
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 4]
Got a little girl, her name is Ball
Give a little bit, she took it all
I said step it up and go-Yeah, man
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 5]
Me an' my baby walking down the street
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 6]
Tell my woman I'll see her at home
Ain't no lovin' since she been gone
Gotta step it up and go-Yeah, go
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

[Verse 7]
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more
Hear my gal call me and I got to go
Step it up and go-Yeah, man
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go

Don't know why
Theres no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor old self together
I'm weary all the time
The time
So weary all the time

When she went away
The blues walked in and they met
If she stays away that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above is gonna let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time

Backing singers:
When she went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away that old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I
Ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
The time
Keeps raining all the time

(Intro)

Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
Id ask him what the matter was
But I know that he dont talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And they furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Well, Shakespeare, hes in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if shes talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, Oh, I didnt know that
But then again, theres only one Ive met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Grandpa died last week
And now hes buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew hed lost control
When I, he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldnt it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
Then I whispered, said Not even you can hide
You see, youre just like me
I hope youre satisfied
Aw, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, Jump right in
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, Aw come on now
You know ya' know about my debutante
And she says, Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh, Mama, is this really the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government

The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off

Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doin' it again

You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen

Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but

The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D. A

Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try No Doz

Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes

You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is gonna sell

Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail

Look out kid
You're gonna get hit

But losers
Cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters

Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters

Ah, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success

Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift

Look out kid
They keep it all hid

Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals

Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

I got my back to the sun cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
You cant turn backyou cant come back, sometimes we push too far
One day youll open up your eyes and youll see where we are

Sugar Baby get on down the road
You aint got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide em bad enough
Im staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, shes not really my aunt
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you cant

Sugar Baby get on down the line
You aint got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

The ladies down in Darktown, theyre doing the Darktown Strut
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There aint no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, loves not an evil thing

Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You aint got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse

Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You aint got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Just as sure as were living, just as sure as youre born
Look up, look upseek your Makerfore Gabriel blows his horn

Sugar Baby, get on down the line
You aint got no sense, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

[Verse 1]
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where theres still something going on

I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood

Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Well, Im standing on the table, Im proposing a toast to the king

[Chorus]
Well Im driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say, Youre a worn-out star
My pockets are loaded and Im spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know its me all the time?

[Verse 2]
Well, the fogs so thick you cant spy the land
The fog is so thick that you cant even spy the land
What good are you anyway, if you cant stand up to some old businessman?

Wedding bells are ringing, the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir's beginning to sing
What looked good in the day, at night is another thing

Shes looking into my eyes, shes-a holding my hand
She looking into my eyes, shes holding my hand
She said, You cant repeat the past, I said, You cant? What do you mean
You cant? Of course you can.

[Chorus]

Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry thats nothing you would need to know
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like its stuck
Why dont you break my heart one more time just for good luck?

[Verse 3]
I got eight carburetors, boys Im using em all
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, Im using em all
Im short on gas, my motors starting to stall

My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails aint going down

You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If its information you want you can go get it from the police

[Chorus]

Politician's got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyesyou been teasing me

[Verse 4]
Standing by Gods river, my soul is beginning to shake
Standing by Gods river, my soul is beginning to shake
Im counting on you love, to give me a break

Well, Im leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes, Im leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Gonn' break the roof inset fire to the place as a parting gift

Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days, summer nights are gone
I know a place where theres still something going on

[Verse 1]
Well, the pressures down, the boss ain't here
He gone North, for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, thats a cute hat
And that smiles so hard to resist
But whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 2]
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
Its done with a flick of the wrist
Whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 3]
You know, a woman like you should be at home
Thats where you belong
Watching out for someone who loves you true
Who would never do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, theres no way to tell by that first kiss
Whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 4]
You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

[Verse 5]
You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before you came in the door
They say in your fathers house, theres many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
Whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 6]
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

[Verse 7]
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
Theres only one step down from here, baby
Its called the land of permanent bliss
Whats a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 1]
One time in London Id gone out for a walk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view
To anyone passing by, thats who theyre talking to

[Verse 2]
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
About the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes
Its too bright a light, he said, for anybodys eyes
If youve never seen one its a blessing in disguise

[Verse 3]
I moved in closer, got up on my toes
Two men in front of me were coming to blows
The man was saying something bout children when theyre young
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung

[Verse 4]
The news of the day is on all the time
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free
Dont let an egg get laid in it by something you cant see

[Verse 4]
Pray for peace! he said. You could feel it in the crowd
My thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud
It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on

[Verse 5]
It will lead you into some strange pursuits
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits
It will scramble up your head and drag your brain about
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out

[Verse 6]
Its all been designed, he said, to make you lose your mind
And when you go back to find it, theres nothing there to find
Every time you look at it, your situations worse
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse"

[Verse 7]
The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
There was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran
The T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me
Later on that evening, I watched it on T.V

These are the words of a frontier man
Who lost his love when he turned bad

[Verse 1]
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell here where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her that I had to see the world
Tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she'd better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail

[Verse 2]
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please, don't mention the stage coach
And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day

[Verse 3]
Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart is aching for Mary
Lord know I miss her so
Just tell her that I went to Timbukto
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold

[Verse 1]
Why must you always try to make me over ?
Take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 2]
You're trying to reshape me in a moment
In the image of someone you used to know
I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 3]
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 4]
You're trying to reshape me in a mould love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

[Verse 1]
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
"Come along and take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids"
Yippee

[Verse 2]
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn't come close to a mountain
And I hate bears

[Verse 3]
Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
"Oh well," I said "it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier"

[Verse 4]
Well, we all got on, and what do you think?
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-going down
Funny way to start a picnic

[Verse 5]
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people, I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six-thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
Women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
Paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

[Verse 6]
I got shoved down, got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn't walk
I couldn't talk, smell, feel
Couldn't see
Didn't know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though

[Verse 7]
Well, feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I'd never got up that mornin'

[Verse 8]
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want to hear it
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom

[Verse 9]
Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic

Well, I was feeling sad and feeling blue
I didnt know what in the world I wus gonna do
Them Communists they wus coming around
They wus in the air
They wus on the ground
They wouldnt give me no peace

[Verse 2]
So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walking down the road
Yee-hoo, Im a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

[Verse 3]
Now we all agree with Hitlers views
Although he killed six million Jews
It dont matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you cant say he was a Communist!
Thats to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria

[Verse 4]
Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldnt find them

[Verse 5]
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away

[Verse 6]
Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
Figured they woos in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did them hard-core ones

[Verse 7]
Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!
That old Betsy Ross

[Verse 8]
Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I know
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me

[Verse 9]
Now Eisenhower, hes a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge theres just one man
Thats really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus

[Verse 10]
Well, I finally started thinking straight
When I run out of things to investigate
Couldnt imagine doing anything else
So now Im sitting home investigating myself!
Hope I dont find out anything hmm, great God!

[Verse 1]
Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought Id seen some ups and downs
Till I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky

[Verse 2]
Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didnt feel so cold then

[Verse 3]
I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

[Verse 4]
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here

[Verse 5]
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved them sound
He was raving about how he loved them sound
Dollar a days worth

[Verse 6]
And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues

[Verse 7]
Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didnt take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin about
A lot of people dont have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks n knives
And they got to cut something

[Verse 8]
So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York
Howdy, East Orange

[Verse 1]
One time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walking to World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
"I wouldnt worry about it none, though
Them old dreams are only in your head"

[Verse 2]
I said Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain
He said Nurse, get your pad, the boys insane
He grabbed my arm, I said Ouch!
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said Tell me about it

[Verse 3]
Well, the whole thing started at 3 oclock fast
It was all over by a quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on us

[Verse 4]
Well, I got up and I walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day

[Verse 4]
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
Give me a string bean, Im a hungry man
A shotgun fired, and away I ran
I dont blame 'em too much though, he didn't know me

[Verse 5]
Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said Howdy friend, I guess theres just us two
He screamed a bit, and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

[Verse 6]
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
I said Lets go and play Adam and Eve
I took her by the hand, and my heart it was thumping
When she said Hey man, you crazy or something?
You seen what happened last time they started

[Verse 7]
Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown
There was nobody around
I got into the drivers seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war

[Verse 8]
Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didnt pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didnt work so well
Turned on my record player 
It was Rock-a-day Johnny singing Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Loves A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah

[Verse 9]
I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
When you hear the beep it will be three oclock
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

[Verse 10]
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying Hey Ive been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different, you see
I dreamed that the only person left after the war was me
I didnt see you around"

[Verse 11]
Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybodys having them dreams
Everybody sees their self
Walking around with no one else

[Outro]
"Half of the people can be part right all of the time
And some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people cant be all right all of the time"
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
Ill let you be in my dream if I can be in yours
I said that

I saw it advertised one day
Bear Mountain picnic was comin' my way
"Come along 'n' take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and kids
Bring the whole family."
Yippee!

Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket
To this Bear Mountain Picnic
But little did I realize
I was in for a picnic surprise
Had nothin' to do with mountains
I didn't even come close to a bear

Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier
Six thousand people there
Everybody had ticket for the trip
"Oh well." I said, "it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier."

Well, we all got on 'n' what d'ya think
That big old boat started t' sink
More people kept a-pilin' on
That old ship was a-slowly goin' down
Funny way t' start a picnic

Well, I soon lost track of m' kids 'n' wife
So many people there I never saw in m' life
That old ship sinkin' down in the water
Six thousand people tryin' t' kill each other
Dogs a-barkin', cats a-meowin'
Women screamin', fists a-flyin', babies cryin'
Cops a-comin', me a-runnin'
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

I got shoved down 'n' pushed around
All I could hear there was a screamin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
Just remember walkin' up on a little shore
Head busted, stomach cracked
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked...
Quite lucky to be alive though

Feelin' like I climbed outa m' casket
I grabbed back hold of m' picnic basket
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home
Wishin' I'd never got up that morn

Now, I don't care just what you do
If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it
'Cause, see, I just lost all m' picnic spirit
Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic...
In the bathroom

Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are gonna do f'r money
There's a bran' new gimmick every day
Just t' take somebody's money away
I think we oughta take some o' these people
And put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain...
For a picnic

[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
He was laying in bed
Wond'ring if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standing at the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the old East Coast
Lord knows he paid some dues, getting through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
And split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
She said "This can't be the end
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue
Tangled up in blue."

[Verse 3]
He had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But he never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So he drifted down to L.A
Where he reckoned he tried his luck
Working for a while in an airplane plant
Loading cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In a spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's about to do the same
She was standing there, back of my chair
Saying "Tell me, what's your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines of my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoes
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"Thought you'd never say hello", she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And flowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
He was always in a hurry
Too busy or too stoned
And everything that she ever planned
Just had to be postponed
He thought they were successful
She thought they were blessed
With objects and material things
But I never was impressed
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 7]
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctor's wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue

Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafs at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out

Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew

I buyed me a little dog, color it was brown
I learned him to whistle, sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears they were quite broad
Around the world in half a day and on him I could ride
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a little bull about four inches high
Everybody feared him that ever heard him cry
When he begins to bellow it made such melodious sound
Till all the walls in London came tumbling to the ground
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a flock of sheep, I thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool, sometimes they yielded feathers
I think mine are the very best sheep for yielding me increase
For every full and change of the moon they bring both lambs and geese
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a little box about four acres square
I filled it full of guineas and silver so fair
Oh now I'm bound for Turkey, I'll travel like an ox
In my breeches pocket, I'll carry my little box
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a little hen, all speckled gay and fair
I sat her on an oyster shell, she hatched me out a hare
The hare it sprang a handsome horse full fifteen hands high
And him that tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie
Sing taddle o day

We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day
And now you throw us all aside
And put us on our way
Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him, "No"?

Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I always the one who must be the thief?
Come to me now, you know

And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought it was nothing more

Now, I want you to know that while you watched

Ol black Bascom, doesnt break no mirrors
Cold black water dog, make no tears
You say you love me with what may be love
Dont you remember making baby love?
Got your steam drill bit and youre looking for some kid
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did
But I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind

[Chorus]
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma
Tell me, momma, what is it?
Whats wrong with you this time?

[Verse 2]
Hey, John, come and get me some candy goods
Shucks, it sure feels like its in the woods
Spend some time on your January trips
You got tombstone moose up and your grave-yard whips
If youre anxious to find out when your friendships gonna end
Come on, baby, Im your friend!
And I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, we bone the editor, cant get rid
But his painted sled, instead its a bed
Yes, I see you on your window ledge
But I cant tell just how far away you are from the edge
And, anyway, youre just gonna make people jump and roar
Watcha wanna go and do that for?
For I know that you know that I know that you know
Something is tearing up your mind

[Chorus]
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I have heard rumors all over town
They say that youre planning to put me down
All I'd like you to do
Is tell me that it isnt true

[Verse 2]
They say that youve been seen with some other man
That hes tall, dark and handsome, and youre holdin' his hand
Darling, Im a'countin on you
Tell me that it isnt true

[Bridge]
To know that some other man is holdin' you tight
It hurts me all over, it doesnt seem right

All of these awful things that I have heard
I dont wanna believe them, all I want is your word
So darlin', you better come through
Tell me that it isnt true

All of these awful things that I have heard
I dont want to believe them, all I want is your word
So darlin', I'm countin' on you
Tell me that it isnt true

[Verse 1]
Tell me--Ive got to know
Tell me--tell me before I go
Does that flame still burn, Does that fire still glow
Or has it died out and melted like the snow
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 2]
Tell me--what are you focused upon
Tell me--will it come to me after you're gone
Tell me quick with a glance or a sigh
Shall I hold you close or  let you go by
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 3]
Is that the heat and the beat of your pulse that I feel
If it's not that then what are you tryin' to conceal
Do you have any secrets
That will only come out in time
Do you lay in your bed
Do you stare at the stars
Is your main friend someone whos an old acquaintance of ours
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 4]
Tell me--are those rock'n'roll dreams in your eyes
Tell me--behind what door your treasure lies
Ever gone broke in a big way
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 5]
Is this some kind of game that youre playing with my heart
How deep must I go? When do I start?
Do you have any morals
Do you have any point of view
Is that a smile that I see on your face
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 6]
Tell me--is that man's name in your book
Tell me--will you go back and take another look
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies
Are you anybody's someone prays for or cries
Tell me
Tell me

The river whispers in my ear
I've hardly a penny to my name
The heavens never seemed so near
All of my body glows with flame

The tempest struggles in the air
And to myself alone I sing
It could sink me then and there
I can hear the echoes ring

I tried to find one smiling face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lying restless in a heavy bed

Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come from your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind

Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me, you'll understand
Emotions we can never share

You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now

I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gate

Beneath the thunder blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
The stars are cold, the night is young

The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floating by
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky

The evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The woods are dark, the town is too
They'll drag you down, they'll run the show
Ain't no telling what they'll do

Tell ol' Bill when he comes home
That anything is worth a try
Tell him that I'm not alone
And that the hour has come to do or die

All the world I would defy
Let me make it plain as day
I look at you now and I sigh
How could it be any other way?

[Verse 1]
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

[Verse 2]
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

[Verse 5]
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

[Verse 6]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

[Verse 7]
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

[Verse 12]
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

[Verse 18]
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"

[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

[Verse 30]
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

[Verse 41]
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea

Standing on your window, honey
Yes, Ive been here before
Feeling so harmless
Im looking at your second door
How come you dont send me no regards?
Ya' know I want your loving
Honey, why are you so hard?

Kneeling neath your ceiling
Yes, I guess Ill be here for a while
Im trying to read your portrait, but
Im helpless, like a rich mans child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your lovin
Honey, why you so hard?

Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime
Or is it just solid rock?

Well, I lean into your hallway
Lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your lovin
Honey, but youre so hard

(Verse 4)
Achilles is in your alleyway
He dont want me here, he does brag
Hes pointing to the sky
And hes hungry, like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your lovin'
Honey, but youre so hard

Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll 'round heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll 'round heaven all day

Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining, tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll 'round heaven all day

Oh Lord above can't you know I'm pining, tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll 'round heaven all day

Hat old black magic has weaved its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
Same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

Same old tingle that I feel inside
And then that elevator starts its ride
And down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in the tide

I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love

I should stay away but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame
Aflame with burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

For you're the lover I have waited for
You're the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Baby down and down I go, round and round I go
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
I'm under that old black magic called love
Oh in a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
In a spin, loving the spin I'm in
Under that old black magic called love
Under that old black magic called love

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart

Paroles de la chanson 1913 Massacre :
Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan in the copper country
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
And the miners are having their big Christmas ball

I'll take you in a door and up a high stairs
Singing and dancing is heard ev'rywhere
I'll let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance 'round the big Christmas tree

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air
And the spirit of Christmas is there ev'rywhere
Before you know it you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall

You ask about work and you ask about pay
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day
Working their copper claims, risking their lives
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives

A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
To hear all this fun; you would not realize
That the copper boss thug men are milling outside

The copper boss thugs stuck their heads in the door

One of them yelled and he screamed, "There's a fire"
A lady she hollered, "There's no such a thing;
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing."

A few people rushed and there's only a few
"It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you."
A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out

And then others followed, about a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor
The gun thugs, they laughed at their murderous joke
And the children were smothered on the stairs by the
Door

Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there was seventy-three

The piano played a slow funeral tune
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon
The parents, they cried and the men, they moaned
"See what your greed for money has done?"
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms when crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 2]
They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 3]
Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 4]
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Outro]
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

[Verse 1]
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain

[Verse 2]
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
Could ya please not stare at me like that?, he said
Its just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide

[Verse 3]
Well, Judas, he just winked and said
Alright, Ill leave you here
But youd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear
Im gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where youll be
Judas pointed down the road
And said, Eternity!

[Verse 4]
Eternity? said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
Thats right, said Judas, Eternity
Though you might call it Paradise
I dont call it anything
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
All right, said Judas Priest
Ill see you after a while

[Verse 5]
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feeling low and mean
When just then a passin' stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father's deceased?
Well, if you are, theres a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest

[Verse 6]
Oh, yes, he is my friend
Said Frankie Lee in fright
I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight
Yes, thats the one, said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
Well, my message is, hes down the road
Stranded in a house

[Verse 7]
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
What kind of house is this, he said
Where I have come to roam?
Its not a house, says Judas Priest
Its not a house, its a home

[Verse 8]
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over evrything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a womans face in evry one

[Verse 9]
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst

[Verse 10]
No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
Nothing is revealed

[Verse 11]
Well, the moral of this story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong
So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin'
Help him with his load
And dont go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

In 1974 I played the first of many shows with the Bandmaybe in eight years. We were in a hockey arena in Chicago. There were maybe 18,000 people there. The Band and I hadnt played publicly together since 1966 where our shows caused a lot of disruption and turmoila lot of anger. Now we were in Chicago starting up again. There was no way to predict what was going to happen. At the end of the concert we had played over 25 or 30 songs and we were standing on the stage looking out. The audience was in semi-darkness. All of a sudden, somebody lit a match. And then somebody else lit another match. In short time, there were areas of the arena that were engulfed in matches. Within seconds after that, it looked like the whole arena was in flames and that all the people in the arena had struck matches and were going to burn the place down. The Band and I looked for the nearest stage exit as none of us wanted to go down in flames. It seemed like nothing had changed. If we thought the response was extreme on the earlier tours we played, this was positively apocalyptic. Every one of us on the stage thought that wed really done it this timethat the fans were going to burn the arena down. Obviously we were wrong. We misinterpreted and misunderstood the reaction of the crowd. What we believed to be disapproval was actually a grand appreciative gesture. Appearances can be deceiving.

For this series of paintings, the idea was to create pictures that would not be misinterpreted or misunderstood by me or anybody else. When the Halcyon Gallery brought the idea of me doing American landscapes for an exhibition, all they had to do was say it once. And after a bit of clarification, I took it to heart and ran with it. The common theme of these works having something to do with the American landscapehow you see it while crisscrossing the land and seeing it for what its worth. Staying out of the mainstream and traveling the back roads, free-born style. I believe that the key to the future is in the remnants of the past. That you have to master the idioms of your own time before you can have any identity in the present tense. Your past begins the day you were born and to disregard it is cheating yourself of who you really are.

My idea was to keep things simple, only deal with what is externally visible. These paintings are up to the moment realismarchaic, most static, but quivering in appearance. They contradict the modern world. However, thats my doing. The San Francisco Chinatown street stands merely two blocks away from corporate, windowless buildings. But these cold giant structures have no meaning for me in the world that I see or choose to see or be a part of or gain entrance to. If you look half a block away from the Coney Island hot-dog stand, the sky is littered with high rises. I choose not to see them either. Down the road, across the highway from the Cabin in the Woods is a manicured golf course. But it has little meaning compared to the seemingly worthless shack which speaks to me. The Alabama Side Show is surrounded by woods in all directions. The side show happens to be in a clearing and you go there by dirt road. I chose to paint the side show instead of the endless woods. There are countless other works where this is also true.

All the iconography is used in a semi-conscious way. I chose images because of the meanings they have for me, and patterns can be seen in the repeating imagesroads, shacks, piers, automobiles, streets, bayous, railroad tracks, bridges, motels, truck stops, power lines, farmyards, theater marquees, churches, signs and symbols, etc.all establishing a certain type of compositional value. I would say the purpose is plain, non-experimental or exploratory.

Some of these works have much complexity of detail. Some are less demanding . . . in some cases my hand couldnt do what my eye was perceiving. So I went to the camera-obscura method. The camera obscura was a primitive camera invented in the 1600s which projected an image upside down so the painter could work from it. This was a real camera, but the image was not printable. It could only be seen and filled in. Caravaggio used this in about all of his paintings and so did Van Eyck and Vermeer. These days you dont have to go to all that trouble. You can use a real camera. I put a 58-mm 0.43x wide-angle conversion lens onto a used Nikon D3300 Af-p on quite a few paintings, Downtown Bank, Katzs, Nathans, Russ & Daughters, Roys, Blue Line, among others, and was able to get the desired effect. If that didnt work, I used a convex Plexiglass RCA 24 x 20 television screen that can be found in old junk shops and looked at the world through that. On Curry Road in Arizona, I used an old movie frame, and I did that on a couple of different paintings, too. In just as many others I drew it straight on. Topanga Ranch, Ice Cream Factory, Truck Stops, Flat Top Mt. Diner, and Del Rio Cantina. The method with the particular altered lens was used for fullness of effect. In a lot of the other cases, all I needed was a straight edge, compass, and a T square going on a case-by-case basis without abandoning tradition or adhering to any conventions or aesthetic doctrines.

The watercolors and acrylics done here purposely show little or no emotion, yet I would say they are not necessarily emotionally stringent. The attempt was made to represent reality and images as they are without idealizing them. My idea is to compose works that create stability, working with generalized, universal, and easily identifiable objects. Throughout, there is the attempt to depict scenes of life and inanimate life for their own sake (Ice Cream Shack, Arcade, Threatening Skies). Da Vinci paints a blurred pictureyou see no lines but clouds that fade into one another with different color schemes. An opposing view would be Mondrian and Van Gogh with strict lines that define the volumes of space. In the middle somewhere would be Kandinsky and Rouault. And these paintings would probably fall into that category.

An attempt was made to depersonalize the worksstrip them of illusion. All the work is exclusively placed in non-exotic settings within a rationally defined space. The focus points are important and sometimes unusually placed. Background and foreground not easily defined. In Amusement Park Alleyway, the focus point is the Ferris wheel in the background. The orange Chevy truck might be centered in the foreground but its not the focal point. In Morning in Pittsburgh, the focal point would be the bridge in the background instead of the larger warehouse in the foreground. Just like in the Flat Top Diner, the focal point might actually be the green trees.

I tried to create the two dimensional image using a mathematical system. At times, the background and foreground converge. Natural scenery is always the main feature. These are not crowded compositions. They are using basic structures to express feelings and ideas. Perfect proportion and logic instead of emotion. The nature of beauty, the lines, forms, shape, and texture that emphasize the recognizable create harmony where natural scenery is the main feature.

I restricted myself to traditional subject matter, viewing nothing as shallow or gaudy. A simple hot-dog stand can have classical features, and I view it as such (Donut Shop, High Wire). Whiplash curves, flying buttresses, pointed steeples, arches, and waves. They are all there, reflecting any time period, purposely trying to stay away from dramatic or theatrical lighting effects, bringing naturalism to the forefront.

In some paintings, the brightness of reflected light was brought forth in evident brushstrokes. Sometimes sunlight hitting certain places would contrast deeply with areas of shadow (Sunset on the Prairie, Threatening Skies). I tried to avoid skewed perspectives or man-made light, yet sometimes it couldnt be avoided. An expert painter is a master in color theory, which means he can turn white into black using a complex value system of colors and hues like a Mark Rothko. The Beaten Path however, reflects explorations in color, sometimes using colors that become less pronounced and outlines that become less precise. Other times tipping toward the monochromatic (Oil Riggers Shack, Twilight After Dusk).

Flowing or curved lines form another visual vehicle, suggesting a far distance in a landscape painting. Architecture itself is always a vital source of ideas and inspiration, but, always, The Beaten Path tries to return to the traditional methods of perceptionsthings that are perceived in the visible worldtaking the three dimensional into a two dimensional format using contrast, location, isolation, and convergence.

If there is a soundtrack to this compilation of paintings, I would say it could be recordings by Peetie Wheatstraw in some places, Charlie Parker in others, Clifford Brown or Blind Lemon, maybe Guitar Slimartists that make us a lot bigger when listening to them. It would have to be that way. Absolutely.

There was a conscious attempt to dismiss consumer culture or popular culture, including mass media, commercial art, celebrities, consumer or product packaging, billboard signs, comic strips, magazine advertising. The Beaten Path works represent a different subject matter from the everyday imagery of consumer culture. There is nothing to suggest these paintings were inspired by the writings of Sigmund Freud or that they were based on any mental images that occur in dreams, no fantasy worlds, religious mysticism or ambiguous subject matter. In every picture the viewer doesnt have to wonder whether its an actual object or a delusional one. If the viewer visited where the picture actually existed, he or she would see the same thing. It is what unites us all.

Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started to hum
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine, I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before but, baby, you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here!

The best is yet to come and, babe, won't it be fine
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine

I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Now the years go rushing by me
They are rocking evenly
I am older than I once was
But I'm younger than I'll be, that's not unusual
No it isn't strange
After changes upon changes we are more, or less the same
After changes we are more, or less the same

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
But the fighter still remains

[Verse 1]
The jingle bells are jingling
The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know

I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

[Verse 2]
I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I've missed
But what's the use of stopping
When there's no one on your list

You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

[Verse 3]
When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joy
But friends, when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys

[Verse 4]
May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But till it's January
I'll just go and disappear

[Verse 5]
Old Santa may have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered Christmas blues

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer
Really know how to fly

[Verse 4]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Verse 1]
'Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till

[Verse 2]
Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street

[Verse 3]
Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing' him and to watch him slowly die

[Verse 4]
And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind

[Verse 5]
I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea

[Verse 6]
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!

[Verse 7]
This song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live

[Verse 1]
The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 2]
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 3]
And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 4]
This star drew nigh to the northwest
Over Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 5]
Then did they know assuredly
Within that house the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the Babe in poverty
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 6]
Then entered in those wise men three
Full reverently upon their knee
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh and frankincense
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

[Verse 7]
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven
And earth of naught
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought
Noel Noel Noel Noel!
Born is the King of Israel!

..on slim hands waiting
Flash bright in candlelight till Sunday's early morn
We found her room that rainy morning
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home

Some red French wine when later waiting
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair
We talked of all, we talked of nothing
I left with promises to meet, she told me where

Oh, but she laughed each time I asked her name
Made promises to meet again
But her friends down at the French caf
Had no English words for me

So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings..

'Twas in the year of '92
In the merry month of June
I left my mother and a home so dear
All for that girl on the greenbriar shore

My mother, she says, "Son, don't go
Don't leave me here alone
Don't leave your mother and a home so dear
Never trust a girl on the greenbriar shore"

But I was young and reckless too
And I craved a reckless life
I left my mother and a home so dear
And I took that girl to be my wife

Her hair was dark and curly too
And her lovin' eyes were blue
Her cheeks were like the red red rose
That girl I loved from the greenbriar shore

The years rolled on and the months rolled by
She left me all alone
Now I remember what my mother said
"Never trust the girl on the greenbriar shore"

[Verse 1]
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
Felt around for the light switch, became nauseated
She was walking down the hallway while the walls deteriorated

[Chorus]
East of the Jordan, hard as the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the burning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 2]
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
About the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the burning of the stage
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 3]
Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she didn't make me feel so obligated

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, west of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the burning of the cage
Curtain rising on a new stage
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 4]
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better standing around like furniture
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
Keep it

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the burning of the stage
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

[Verse 5]
Cities on fire, phones out of order
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border
What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires

[Chorus]
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Twas in the town of Griffin
In the year of sixty-five
A well known famous drover
Stepped up to me and talked
Sayin "How do you do, young cowboy
And howd you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly
In the hills of Mexico"

Well, me being out of work right then
To this drover I did say
"Well, this going out on the buffalo range
Depends on your pay
But if you pay good wages
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
To the hills of Mexico"

Well, we crossed the ?? river, boys
Our troubles they begun
Lightening, flashlight, hell-fire
Had made the cattle run
I tread towards the hiding place

Comanches waiting to pick us off
On the hills of Mexico

Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day

Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress

A few more years of hard work
Then there'll be a thousand years of happiness

I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed

William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didnt even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that alls equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books aint pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For nows the time for your tears

I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows and the water rolls high
I can hear a voice calling out there in the darkness
But I sit here alone too lonesome to cry

Oh, the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no one to love or kiss me goodnight

We met there one night on the banks of the river
Sat there holding hands and making our vow
That we never would part and be happy together
But a new love she's found, she's gone from me now

Oh, the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no one to love or kiss me goodnight

The love that faded left me only tears
Days that were happy turned into lonely years
Vows that we made turned into lies
My life is empty, my lonely heart cries

I tried to forget that we'll never be
Nothing left for me but dust in the breeze
My way is lonely but I think I'm lost
My love was wasted, I'm paying the cost

Brown eyes, blue eyes they're all the same
None are for me, I've lost their game
Tomorrow has nothing but worries and cares
The love that faded left me only tears

Just like the rose your love faded away
Now my lonely heart must break and pay
Nothing now but heartaches through years
The love that faded left me only tears

And as for compensation, theres little he would ask

I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears

But thats just because he doesnt want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me

Virgil Kane is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Till Stoneman's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again

In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the 10th, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
"Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert E. Lee!"

Now, I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need
And you leave the rest
But they should never
Have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"

Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand

He was just 18, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Kane back up
When he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, "Na, na, la, na, na, la"

The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringing

There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

Go out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Has anybody seen my lady
This living alone will drive me crazy
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I'm gonna go down by the wa-ter
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no
I'll just be looking for my mak-er
And I hear that that's where she's been? Oh!
Out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
I just spent sixty days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go
Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in
Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you trying to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
"Fools" said I,"You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you."
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence

I'm trippin' over dumb drunks at a party
Girlfriend just ran off with the DJ
I give her everything, but she refused it
It doesn't matter, she don't know how to use it
My confidence is dwindling
Look at the shape I'm in
Where's my pearls, where's my swine?
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line

I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
Fifty silhouettes bumpin' on the dance floor
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door
Sixty cigarettes a day 'cause I'm nervous
When will that bitch serve us?

I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife
She was good, I was unkind
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line

I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
(On the rocks)
(Two ice cubes)
(And a little umbrella)

Big Jim says the second comin's comin'
I think he's just seein' double or something
Or something

You can hang around waiting for the also rans
I can't win, but I've seen enough, man
A fifth of whiskey he could knock it away
I drink some more and it's judgment day
I had a future, but she just passed out
I'm gonna drink until I see what it is I wanna think about

I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
I'll have the usual
On the rocks
With a twist

[Chorus]
The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings that I could fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

[Verse 1]
There is a ship and it sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

[Verse 2]
I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me

[Verse 3]
Oh love is gentle, love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew

[Chorus]

I pulled into Nazareth just a feelin' 'bout a half past dead
I just need to find a place where I can lay my head
Mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed?
He just grinned and shook my hand and "No" was all he said
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
I picked up my bag and went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw old Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
And I said, "Hey Carmen, come on will you go downtown?"
She said, "Well I gotta go but my friend can stick around anyhow"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Go down Miss Moses, ain't nothin' that you can say
'Cause is just old Luke and Luke's waitin' on the judgment day
Well now Luke my friend, what about young Anna Lee?
He said, "Do me a favor son
Won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company?"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Crazy Chester followed me yeah, and he caught me in the fog
He said, "I would fix your rack, oh yeah if you'll just take Jack, my dog"
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I am a peaceful man"
He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"
Won't ya take a load off Fanny?
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me
Catch a cannon ball now, to take me down the line
'Cause my bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
I want you to take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And you put the load right on me

[Verse 1]
There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter

[Verse 2]
He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
The soles of my feet, I swear theyre burning

[Verse 3]
Oh, the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
If ye cannot bring good news, then dont bring any

I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue

Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw
My flue has a flaw

From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose
It's not as sweet as the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flue
<END TEXT>
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone line rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

There was a man named Hatma Gandi
He would not bow down he would not fight
He knew the deal was down and dirty
And nothing wrong could make it right away
But he knew his duty and the prize he had to pay
Just another holy man who tried to be a friend
My God, they killed him

[Verse 2]
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia
By name of Martin Luther King
He shook the land like the rolling thunder
And made the bells of freedom ring today
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand
My God, they killed him

[Verse 3]
The only Son of God Almighty
The holy one called Jesus Christ
He healed the lame and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him

[Verse 4]
There was a man named Mahatma Gandi
A man named Martin Luther King
The only Son of God Almighty
The only one called Jesus Christ
On the road to glory where the story never ends

A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassins eyes
Im looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
Im well dressed, waiting on the last train

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now Im expecting all hell to break loose

[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
Im locked in tight, Im out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

[Verse 2]
This place aint doing me any good
Im in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Aint no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove

Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Dont get up gentlemen, Im only passing through

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ive been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
Ive been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You cant win with a losing hand

Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I hurt easy, I just dont show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me

Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
Im not that eager to make a mistake

You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin in the rain
From the dirt of words and mud of cell
Your clothes are smeared and stained
But the dirty words and muddy cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
Till you are off again

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

But tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plain from field to town
Marching to be free
And of the rusted prison gates
That tumbled by degree
Like laughing children one by one
Who looked like you and me

Take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down
The crooked rainbow trails
From dancing cliff-edged shattered sills
Of slender shackled jails
But the voices drift up from below
As the walls are being scaled
All of this and more my friend
Your song shall not be failed

Then take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
I'm just lookin' for the evening
And the morning in your eyes

How long can I stay in this nowhere caf
Before night turns into day
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 2]
There's a moment when all old things
Become new again
But that moment might have come and gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 3]
I look away, but I keep seeing it
I don't want to believe, but I keep believing it
Shadows dance upon the wall
Shadows that seem to know it all

[Verse 4]
Am I too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me
I'm lost in the crowd
All my tears are gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

[Verse 5]
Everything I touch seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn you are always here
I'll run this race until my earthly death
I'll defend this place with my dying breath

[Verse 6]
From a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
I saw a star from heaven fall
I turned and looked again but it was gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

Tell old Bill, when he comes home this morning
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening
Tell old Bill, when he comes home
To leave them down-town girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon

Old Sal was baking bread this morning
Old Sal was baking bread this evening
Old Sal was baking bread
When she found out that her Bill was dead
This morning, this evening, so soon

She said Oh no, it cant be so, this morning
Oh no, it cant be so, this evening
She said Oh no, it cant be so
My Bill left home about an hour ago
This morning, this evening, so soon

Well they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning
They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening
Well you know they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon
His arms, his legs, his feet were dragging
This morning, this evening, so soon
So soon, so soon, so soon

Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening
Tell old Bill, when he comes home

[Chorus] [x2]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
As I was walking a ribbon of highway
I saw above me an endless Skyway
I saw below me a golden valley
This land was made for you and me

[Verse 1]
I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The sun comes shining as I was strolling
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
As I was walking - I saw a sign there
And that sign said - no tress passing
But on the other side. It didn't say nothing!
Now that side was made for you and me!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumbling and some are wondering
If this land's still made for you and me

[Chorus] [x2]

One dream in my heart, one love to be living for
One love to be living for, this nearly was mine
One girl for my dream, one partner in paradise
This promise of paradise, this nearly was mine
Close to my heart she came, only to fly away
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone, still dreaming of paradise
Still saying that paradise once nearly was mine

This old man, he played ten
He played knick-knack now an' then
With a knick-knack paddywhack
Give your dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

[Verse 1]
If your memory serves you well
We were going to meet again and wait
So Im going to unpack all my things
And sit before it gets too late
No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell
But you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well

[Chorus]
This wheels on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!

[Verse 2]
If your memory serves you well
I was going to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailors knot
And hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours
But it was oh so hard to tell
But you knew that we would meet again
If your memory serves you well

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If your memory serves you well
Youll remember youre the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done
And after evry plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell
You knew that we would meet again
If your memory served you well

[Chorus]

As I went walking
That ribbon of highway
I saw above me
An endless skyway
I saw below me
That golden valley
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

I've roamed and rambled
I followed my footsteps
Through the sunny bright sands of
Her diamond deserts
And all around me
A voice came singing
Singing this land was made for you and me

This land is your land
And this land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

It was early one morning
And I was strolling
With the wheat fields waving
And dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting
A voice comes chanting

This land is your land
This land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Nobody living
Can ever stop me
As I go walking
My freedom highway
Nobody living
Can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
And this land is my land
From California
To the New York island
From the Redwood Forest
To the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

Three angels up above the street
Each one playing a horn
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out
Theyve been there since Christmas morn
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash
Then a lady in a bright orange dress
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels
The Tenth Avenue bus going west
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around
A man with a badge skips by
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work
Nobody stops to ask why
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on their poles
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls
The angels play on their horns all day
The whole earth in progression seems to pass by
But does anyone hear the music they play
Does anyone even try?

Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go

I was thinking' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I have been looking for her even clear through Tennessee

Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say

Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day

The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try something' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shining'
And the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need

I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder
What's the matter with this cruel world today

Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing

Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows

I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams

Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen
Better roll your airplane down

Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed  no need to confess again

Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

Songwriter:  Bob Dylan

[Verse 1]
Well, I had to move fast
And I couldnt with you around my neck
I said Id send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we havent even started yet
Ill go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
Ill remember to forget

[Verse 2]
Im going to get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
Theres something Ive got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

[Verse 3]
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I dont know
Has anybody seen my love?

[Verse 4]
You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Whatever you got to say to me
Wont come as any shock
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep
She said, Be easy, baby
There is nothing worth stealing in here

[Verse 5]
Youre the one Ive been looking for
Youre the one thats got the key
But I cant figure out whether Im too good for you
Or youre too good for me

[Verse 6]
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I dont know
Has anybody seen my love?

[Verse 7]
Well, theyre not showing any lights tonight
And theres no moon
Theres just a hot-blooded singer
Singing Memphis in June
While theyre beating the devil out of a guy
Whos wearing a powder-blue wig
Later hell be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up is never that big

[Outro]
Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mine

[Verse 1]
Well, my nerves are exploding and my bodys tense
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
Ive been hit too hard, Ive seen too much
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right till I fell in love with you

[Verse 2]
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like Im coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he wont lead me astray
Still I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right till I fell in love with you

[Verse 3]
Boys in the street beginning to play
Girls like birds flying away
When Im gone you will remember my name
Im gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right till I fell in love with you

[Verse 4]
Junk is piling up, taking up space
My eyes feel like theyre falling off my face
Sweat falling down, Im staring at the floor
Im thinking about that girl who wont be back no more
I dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right till I fell in love with you

[Verse 5]
Well, Im tired of talking, Im tired of trying to explain
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If Im still among the living, Ill be Dixie bound
I just dont know what Im gonna do
I was all right till I fell in love with you

Time passes slowly up here in the mountain
We sit beside the bridges and walk beside the fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float though the stream
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking
She sat in the kitchen while her mama was cooking
Stared on out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when you're searching for love
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain't no reason to go to the fair
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down
Ain't no reason to go anywhere
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away

[Verse 1]
It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: Boss, the ladys gone
She left this morning just fore dawn.

[Verse 2]
You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can
Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand

[Verse 3]
The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

[Verse 4]
Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer (The Boss)

[Verse 5]
Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went

[Verse 6]
He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

[Verse 7]
Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

[Verse 8]
He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who

[Verse 9]
He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

[Verse 10]
They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
Got a strange premonition theres a man close by (Henry Lee)
Dont worry about him, he wouldnt harm a fly (The Wife)

[Verse 11]
From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

[Verse 12]
She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
Youre a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise (The Wife)

[Verse 13]
Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick (The Boss)

[Verse 14]
Silly boy, you think me a saint
Ill listen no more to your words of complaint
Youve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes (The Wife)

[Verse 15]
Id have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world youll see (The Boss)

[Verse 16]
Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold (The Wife)
Oh, my dear, you must be blind
Hes a gutless ape with a worthless mind (The Boss)

[Verse 17]
Youve had your way too long with me
Now its me wholl determine how things shall be (The Wife)
Try to escape, he cussed and cursed
Youll have to try to get past me first (The Boss)

[Verse 18]
Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why? (The Boss)

[Verse 19]
Ill have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, Ill see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle youll wish youd died (Henry Lee)

[Verse 20]
The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin

[Verse 21]
He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, hes as good as dead

[Verse 22]
You shot my husband down, you fiend (The Wife)
Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind (Henry Lee)

[Verse 23]
This she said with angry breath
You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life (The Wife)
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

[Verse 24]
His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
Youre a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you dont mind, Ill have the knife (Henry Lee)

[Verse 25]
Were two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But were no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know (The Wife)
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

[Verse 26]
His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt (Henry Lee)

[Verse 27]
She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
You died for me, now Ill die for you (The Wife)
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through

[Verse 28]
All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

Is it rolling, Bob?

[Verse 1]
To be alone with you
Just you and me
Now wont you tell me true
Aint that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Everything is always right
When Im alone with you

[Verse 2]
To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while lifes pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when Im alone with you

[Verse 3]
They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But youre always what Im thinkin' of
I wish the night were here
Bringin' me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms

[Verse 4]
Ill always thank the Lord
When my workin' day is through
I get my sweet reward
To be alone with you
<END TEXT>
A tear go down
My day is real
But your dying eye
Upon the shame
Each needs a road
For me from you
What paradise?
What can I do?
That die for my
And the day is dark
I can['t] believe
[for the end of time]
What I could find
Oh time is rye-ou-lou
'f I fell in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
With you

The day is dark
Our time is right
Day in the night
Deep in the night
I cant yet be back
I hear-a my-a surprise
I see it in you live
I knew it in your eyes
Well I feel your love
And I feel no shame
I can't unleash your horde
I call your name
What you're to me
What can I do?
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
With you

It just rolls
Upon the sand
[?] now
I made the man
Can make you feel
What I can find
I know it in my days
Ah in my dreary mind
Oh will ages roll
Will ages fly
I hear your name
Where angel lie
What do I know?
For to come it's true
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
With you

How can the doors
A trust on a nail
How can I be surprised
Of most everything
Ah in the distant road
I can['t] be the same
I feel no love
I kill no shame
I can't watch the bay
Out on my an own
We've a destined man
I came atist it all
[I didn't] I could find
Where I could go
To fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love
With you

[Verse 1]
Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise
Oh the flowers of the city
Though breath-like
Get death-like at times
And theres no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines

[Verse 2]
Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes Im in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just dont exist
Its all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this

[Verse 3]
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With the worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
Back to the South
Youve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet theres no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

[Verse 4]
Ive heard you say many times
That youre better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta' be just like them

[Verse 5]
Id forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
Ill come and be crying to you

The sweet pretty things are in bed now, of course
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun, she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made"
Then sends for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in"

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison"

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro, behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped a bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank, at a profit, sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin' for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]
Mamas in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 6]
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

[Chorus]
Mamas in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddys in the alley
Hes lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

[Verse 1]
If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasnt such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then Id lie in my bed once again....

[Verse 2]
I cant see my reflection in the waters
I cant speak the sounds that show no pain
I cant hear the echo of my footsteps
Or cant remember the sound of my own name
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then Id lie in my bed once again...

[Verse 3]
Theres beauty in that silver, singing river
Theres beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true loves eyes
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then Id lie in my bed once again...

[Verse 1]
Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said to night ?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrill be gone ?
Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory
Or just another song, that's in my heart to linger on ?

[Verse 2]
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly surrender to me, my darling will it last ?
Tomorrow night, will you be with me when the moon is bright ?
Tomorrow night, will you say those lovely things you said tonight ?

[Verse 3]
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast

[Verse 1]
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there, too
Throw my troubles out the door
I dont need them anymore
'Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you

[Verse 2]
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And Ive waited all day long
For tonight when Ill be staying here with you

[Bridge]
Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive?
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave

[Verse 3]
I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster, too
If theres a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you

[Verse 1]
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there, too
Throw my troubles out the door
I dont need them anymore
'Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you

Now, too much of nothing
Can make a man feel ill at ease
One mans temper might rise
While another mans temper might freeze
In the day of confession
We cannot mock a soul
Oh, when theres too much of nothing
No one has control

[Chorus]
Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Send them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

[Verse 2]
Too much of nothing
Can make a man abuse a king
He can walk the streets and boast like most
But he wouldnt know a thing
Now, its all been done before
Its all been written in the book
But when theres too much of nothing
Nobody should look

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Too much of nothing
Can turn a man into a liar
It can cause one man to sleep on nails
And another man to eat fire
Evrybodys doin something
I heard it in a dream
But when theres too much of nothing
It just makes a fella mean

Tough Mama
Meat shaking on your bones
Im gonna go down to the river and get some stones
Sisters on the highway with that steel-drivin crew
Papas in the big house, his working days are through
Tough Mama
Can I blow a little smoke on you?

[Verse 2]
Dark Beauty
Wont you move over and give me some room?
Its my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies
Dark Beauty
With that long nights journey in your eyes

[Verse 3]
Sweet Goddess
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind
Now, dont be modest, you know who you are and where youve been
Jack the Cowboy went up north
Hes buried in your past
The Lone Wolf went out drinking
That was over pretty fast
Sweet Goddess
Your perfect strangers comin in at last

[Verse 4]
Silver Angel
With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve
Id be grateful if this golden ring you would receive
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch
Sweet Goddess
It must be time to carve another notch

[Verse 5]
Im crestfallen
The world of illusion is at my door
I aint a-hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
The prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight
Ive gained some recognition but I lost my appetite
Dark Beauty
Meet me at the border late tonight

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Unhappy faces behind a painted smile
Heartache and loneliness dressed up in modern style
Unhappy people living in sin and shame
Reflections of myself, life is no easy game
And we're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Here I stand looking, looking around me
While all around me what do I see
Young girls who'll soon become
Streetwalkers in the night
Young boys, the restless breed
Looking for a fight
Children both rich and poor
They're searching for the truth
And if they don't find it
God help tomorrow's youth
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Trade winds are blowing, blowing around me
While all around me what do I see
Hatred and jealousy
Brotherhood is dying
Love is the answer
Nobody's buying
Good people turning bad
Some don't but they are few
The winds are blowing
The choice is all up to you
We're caught in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time

Yes we're caught up in the trade winds
The trade winds of our time
And we are riding on the trade winds
The trade wind of our time

We're caught up
Caught up in the trade winds, the trade winds of our time

We are riding
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

We're caught up
Caught up on the trade winds, the trade winds of our time

And we're riding
Riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

We are riding, yes we're riding
Trade wings of our time

We're caught up
Caught up in the trade winds, trade winds of our time

We are riding
We're riding on the trade wings, trade winds of our time

And we're caught up
In the trade winds, trade winds of our time

We are riding
Riding on the trade wings, the trade winds of our time

Come round you old time cowboys, and listen to my song
Please do not grow weary, I will not detain you long
Concerning some young cowboy, who did agree to go
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo
Well I found myself in Griffin, in the year of '83
When a world-famous drover come a-walkin' up to me
Sayin', "How d'ya do young cowboy. how'd you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo?"
Well me being out of work right then, at this drover I did say
"This a-goin' out on the buffalo range depends upon your pay
But if you pay good wages, transportation to and fro'
Think I might go with you on the hunt of the buffalo."
"yes I will pay good wages and transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me until the season's through
But if you do get homesick and try to run away
You'll starve to death on the prairie and also lose your pay."
Well with all this flatterin' talkin', he signed up quite a train
Some ten to twelve in number, some able-bodied men
Our trip it was a pleasant one as we hit the westward road
Until we hit old Boggy Creek in old New Mexico
Well there our pleasures ended and our troubles they begun
A lightin' storm did hit us, made the cattle run
I got all full of stickers from the cactus that did grow
Outlaws watchin' to pick us off from the hills of the buffalo
Well our workin' season ended, but the drover would not pay
He said, "You went and drunk too much, you're all in debt to me."
But the cowboys never did hear of such a thing as a bankrupt law
So we left tht drover's bones to bleach on the hills of the buffalo

Train of love's a comin', big black wheels are hummin'
People waitin' at the station, happy hearts are drummin'
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Now stop your whistle blowin' 'cause I've got ways of knowin'
You're bringin' other people's lovers but my own keeps goin'
Train of love deceivin', when she's not gone she's leavin'

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Train of love now hasten, sweethearts stand and waitin'
Here and there and everywhere there'll gonna be embracin'
Train men tell me maybe, ain't she got my baby

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Train of love's a leavin', leavin' my heart grievin'
But early or late I sit and wait because I'm still believin'
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever

Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

[Verse 1]
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm
You got your rabbits foot, you got your good-luck charm
But they cant help you none when theres trouble

[Chorus]
Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble

[Verse 2]
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air
Go all the way to the other side of the world, youll find trouble there
Revolution even aint no solution for trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul
Persecution, execution, governments out of control
You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground
You ever feel like youre never alone even when theres nobody else around?
Since the beginning of the universe mans been cursed by trouble

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble

[Chorus]

I got to know, Lord, when to pull back on the reins
Death can be the result of the most underrated pain
Satan whispers to ya, "Well, I don't want to bore ya
But when ya get tired of the Miss So-and-so I got another woman for ya."
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
When the deeds that you do don't add up to zero
It's what's inside that counts, ask any war hero
You think you can hide but you're never alone
Ask Lot what he thought when his wife turned to stone
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
Here comes Satan, prince of the power of the air
He's gonna make you a law unto yourself, gonna build a bird's nest in your hair
He's gonna deaden your conscience 'til you worship the work of your own hands
You'll be serving strangers in a strange, forsaken land
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
Well, your true love has caught you where you don't belong
You say, "Baby, everybody's doing it so I guess it can't be wrong."
The truth is far from you, so you know you got to lie
Then you're all the time defending what you can never justify
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
So many of my brothers, they still want to be the boss
They can't relate to the Lord's kingdom, they can't relate to the cross
They self-inflict punishment on their own broken lives
Put their faith in their possessions, in their jobs or their wives
Trouble in mind, Lord, trouble in mind
Lord, take away this trouble in mind
When my life is over, it'll be like a puff of smoke
How long must I suffer, Lord, how long must I be provoked?
Satan will give you a little taste, then he'll move in with rapid speed
Lord keep my blind side covered and see that I don't bleed

Im getting weary looking in my babys eyes
When shes near me shes so hard to recognize
I finally realize theres no room for regret
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Verse 2]
Hold me, baby be near
You told me that youd be sincere
Every day of the years like playing Russian roulette
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Chorus]
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and Ill tell you when

[Verse 3]
Youre a tearjerker, baby, but Im under your spell
Youre a hard worker, baby, and I know you well
But this weekend in hell is making me sweat
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
You belong to me, baby, without any doubt
Dont forsake me, baby, dont sell me out
Dont keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do whats right and not be second-guessed
Dont trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself

[Verse 2]
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
Dont trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself

[Verse 3]
Well, youre on your own, you always were
In a land of wolves and thieves
Dont put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes

[Verse 4]
Trust yourself
And you wont be disappointed when vain people let you down
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found
Dont trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself

The air is getting hotter
Theres a rumbling in the skies
Ive been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesnt haunt me like it did before
Ive been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 2]
When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
Ive been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 3]
People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin
Like pendulums swinging on chains
I tried to give you everything
That your heart was longing for
Im just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 4]
Im going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I dont know what all right even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now Im trying to get to heaven before they close the door

[Verse 5]
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
Ill close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now Im trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Did ya read about the flood?
Happened long time ago
In Tupelo, Mississippi
There were thousands o' lives
Destroyed

It rained, it rained
Both night and day
The poor people was worried
Didn't have no place to go

Could hear may people, cryin' "Lord, have mercy"
'Cause You're the only one that we can turn to"

Happened a long time ago
A little town
Way back in Mississippi
In Tupelo

There was women, and there was children
They were screamin' an' cryin'
Cryin', "Lord, have mercy
You're the only one now, that we can turn to"

Way back down in Mississippi, a little country town
I know ya read about it
'Cause I'll never forget it
The mighty flood in Tupelo, Mississippi
Been years ago

Lord, have mercy
Wasn't that a mighty time?
Tupelo's gone

One time in London I gone out for a walk
Past the place called Hyde Park where people talk
About all kinds of different gods they have their point of view
To anyone passing by and it's who they're talking to

There was someone on the platform talking to the folks
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes
It's too bright a light he said for anybody's eyes
If you've never seen one it's bleesing in disguise

I moved in closer got up on my toes
Two men in front of me were coming to blows
A man was saying something about children when they're young
Being sacrificed that's why lullabies are being sung

The news of the day is on all the time
All the latest gossip all the latest rhyme
You mind is you temple keep it beautiful and free
Don't let an egg get laid in there by something you can't see

Pray for people he said you could feel it in the crowd
My thoughts began to wander but his voice was ringing loud
It will destroy you family your happy home is gone
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on

It will lead you in to some strange pursuits
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits
Scramble up your head and drag your brain about
Sometimes you got to do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out

It's all been designed he said to make you loose your mind
And when you go back to find it there's nothing there to find
Every time you look at it your situations worse
If you feel it grabbing out for you send for the nurse

The crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man
There was pushing there was showing and everybody ran
The TV crew was there to film it they jumped right over me
Later on that evening I watched it on TV

Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Theyre throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead mans bones
Got their noses to the grindstones

Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

Well, theyre going to the country, theyre gonna retire
Theyre taking a street car named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things theyd like they would never buy

Neither one gonna turn and run
Theyre making a voyage to the sun
His Masters voice is calling me
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze

Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
Your presence is obnoxious to me
Theyre like babies sittin on a womans knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
I got love for you and its all in vain
Brains in the pot, theyre beginning to boil
Theyre dripping with garlic and olive oil

Tweedle-dee Deehes on his hands and his knees
Saying, Throw me somethin, Mister, please
Whats good for you is good for me
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

Well, theyre living in a happy harmony
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Theyre one day older and a dollar short
Theyve got a parade permit and a police escort

Theyre lying low and theyre makin hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

Well a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
My pretty baby, shes lookin around
Shes wearin a multi-thousand dollar gown

Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
Tweedle-dee Dum, hell stab you where you stand
Ive had too much of your company,

He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine
If I ride back again
But if you ride back and I am left
You'll do as much for me
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly

[Verse 2]
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint
Her fond face pale with woe
Her heart will be broken when I am gone
I'll see her soon, I know."
Just then the order came to charge
For an instance hand touched hand
They said, "Aye," and away they rode
That brave and devoted band

[Verse 3]
Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly back again

[Verse 4]
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Momma, you know, awaits the news
And she'll only know he's dead

Who shines like a morning star

Other at the break of day

Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap,in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills but you only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A. look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try "No Doz"
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

[Verse 1]
The woman that I love she got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

[Chorus]
You know I love her
Yeah I love her
I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World

[Verse 2]
If I ever lose her I will go insane
I go half crazy when she calls my name
When she says baby I l-l-love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
When I get low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
The woman that I love she a got a prizefighter nose
Cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

[Verse 1]
Its unbelievable, its strange but true
Its inconceivable it could happen to you
You go north and you go south
Just like bait in the fishs mouth
You must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star
Its unbelievable it would get this far

[Verse 2]
Its undeniable what theyd have you to think
Its indescribable, it can drive you to drink
They said it was the land of milk and honey
Now they say its the land of money
Whoever thought they could ever make that stick
Its unbelievable you can get this rich this quick

[Verse 3]
Every head is so dignified
Every moon is so sanctified
Every urge is so satisfied as long as youre with me
All the silver, all the gold
All the sweethearts you can hold
That doesnt come back with stories untold
Are hanging on a tree

[Verse 4]
Its unbelievable like a lead balloon
Its so impossible to even learn the tune
Kill that beast and feed that swine
Scale that wall and smoke that vine
Feed that horse and saddle up the drum
Its unbelievable, the day would finally come

[Verse 5]
Once there was a man who had no eyes
Every lady in the land told him lies
He stood beneath the silver sky and his heart began to bleed
Every brain is civilized
Every nerve is analyzed
Everything is criticized when you are in need

[Verse 6]
Its unbelievable, its fancy-free
So interchangeable, so delightful to see
Turn your back, wash your hands
Theres always someone who understands
It dont matter no more what you got to say
Its unbelievable it would go down this way

[Verse 1]
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky

[Verse 2]
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
One summers day he came passing by
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And one day he came passing by

[Bridge]
Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new
Someday little girl, youll have a diamond as big as your shoe

[Verse 3]
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie

[Bridge]
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town
This is the blind horse that leads you around

[Verse 4]
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly

[Intro]
Something about you that I cant shake
Dont know how much more of this I can take
Baby, Im under your spell

[Verse 1]
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light
Baby, oh what a story I could tell

Its been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
Baby, Ill be at the same hotel

[Verse 2]
Id like to help you but Im in a bit of a jam
Ill call you tomorrow if theres phones where I am
Baby, caught between heaven and hell

But I will be back, I will survive
Youll never get rid of me as long as youre alive
Baby, cant you tell

[Bridge]
Well its four in the morning by the sound of the birds
Im staring at your picture, Im hearing your words
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell

[Verse 3]
Everywhere you go its enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
I trusted your baby, you can trust me now

[Verse 4]
Turn back baby, wipe your eye
Dont think Im leaving here without a kiss goodbye
Baby, is there anything left to tell?

Ill see you later when Im not so out of my head
Maybe next time Ill let the dead bury the dead
Baby, what more can I tell?

[Outro]
Well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
Pray that I dont die of thirst
Baby, two feet from the well

[Verse 1]
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore
My flashlights from Taiwan
My tablecloths from Malaysia
My belt buckles from the Amazon
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy making thirty cents a day

[Chorus]
Well, its sundown on the union
And whats made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
Till greed got in the way

[Verse 2]
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well, the dog collars from India
And the flower pots from Pakistan
All the furniture, it says Made in Brazil
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know, thats a lot of money to her

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work
I say, Why you say that for
When nothing you got is U. S made?
They dont make nothin here no more
You know, capitalism is above the law
It say, It dont count less it sells
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business, friend
And theyre going out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is going to be against the law

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Democracy dont rule the world
Youd better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess thats better left unsaid
From Broadway to the Milky Way
Thats a lot of territory indeed
And a mans going to do what he has to do
When hes got a hungry mouth to feed

[Chorus]

bullfight posters hang crooked above your head
an the phone rings constantly
you tell me how much ive changed
as if that is all there is t say
out of the side of your mouth
while talkin on the wires
in a completely different
tone of voice
than you had a minute ago
when speakin t me about something else
i say whats this about changes?
you say lets go get drunk

your stairs tilt drastically
your railings rotted
an theres blood at the
bottom of your steps
you say t meet bricks with bricks
i say t meet bricks with chalk
you tell me monster floor plans
an i tell you about a bookie shop

come t help with the door
enlargement. the ones that arrive
however have nothin more than
lets get these doors enlarged
t say t the ones who were
there in the first place. it follows then that
the whole thing revolves around
nothing but this door enlargement idea.
third of all, theres a group now existin
an the only thing that keeps them friends
is that they all want the doors enlarged.
obviously, the doorsre then enlarged
fourth of all,
after this enlargement
the group has t find
something else t keep
them together or
else the door enlargement
will prove t be
embarrassing

on fourteenth street
i meet someone
who i know in front
wants t put me
uptight
wants me t be on

he wants t drag

i too realize that
she will die here
one the side of this sea
her death is certain here
my death is unknown

i love her)

i talk t people every day
involved in some scene
good an evil are but words
invented by those
that are trapped in scenes

on what grounds are the
grounds for judgment
an i think also
that there is not
one thing anyplace
anywhere that makes any
sense. there are only tears
an there is only sorrow
there are no problems

i have seen what ive loved
slip away an vanish. i still
love what ive lost but t run
an try t catch itd
be very greedy
for the rest of my life
i will never chase a livin soul
into the prison grasp
of my own self-love

i cant believe that i have
t hate anybody
an when i do
it will only be out of fear
an ill know it

i know no answers an no truth
for absolutely no soul alive
i will listen t no one
who tells me morals
there are no morals
an i dream a lot

so go joshua
go fit your battle
i have t go t the woods
for a while
i hope you understand
but if you dont
it doesnt matter
i will be with you
nex time around
dont think about me
ill be ok

[Verse 1]
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebodys got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know youre long gone, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 2]
If Id thought about it I never wouldve done it, I guess I wouldve let it slide
If Id lived my life by what others were thinking, the heart inside me wouldve died
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me

[Verse 3]
Oh, the Union Central is pulling out and the orchids are in bloom
Ive only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months Ive only smiled once and I didnt do it consciously
Somebodys got to find your trail, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 4]
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
Id just about convinced myself that nothing had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me

[Verse 5]
Well, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers club
I wouldve followed you in the door but I didnt have a ticket stub
So I waited all night til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me

[Verse 6]
Oh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me

[Verse 7]
Well, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat
Shes everything I need and love but I cant be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be
But she aint a-going to make me move, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 8]
We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex
It didnt amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty
Somebodys got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 9]
Well, Dupree came in pimpin tonight to the Thunderbird Caf
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Well, I just cant rest without you, love, I need your company
But you aint a-going to cross the line, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 10]
Theres a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
Shes the one you been wondering about, but theres really nothing much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebodys got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 11]
So go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you dont have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she aint my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me

[Verse 12]
And if we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you know it was up to me
<END TEXT>
When I get off of this mountain, you know where I want to go?
Straight down the Mississippi river, to the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana, little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by, if there's anything she could do

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk"
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living on the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted to go and see my Bessie again

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play Blind Man's Bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D-train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise she's all right she's just near
She's delicate and seems like veneer
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have not taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain ?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after awhile"
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez
I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"You can't look at much, can you man?"
As she, herself prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage not corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain

I never dreamed there could be
A someone made just for me
And I'm letting her have her way
I'm here to see what she has to say
Ah, the poor girl always wins the day
I'm stayin' ahead of the game
And she's a-doin' the same
And the whiskey flyin' into my head
The fiddler's arm has gone dead
And talk is beginning to spread
When did our love go bad
Whatever happened to the best friend that I had
It's been so long since I held you tight
Been so long since we said good night
The taste of tears is bittersweet
When you're near me my heart forgets to beat
You're there every night among the good and the true
And I'll be 'round waiting for you
Well the king of them all is starting to fall
I lost my gal at the boatman's' ball
The night has a thousand hearts and eyes
Hope may vanish, but it never dies
I'll see you tomorrow when freedom rings
I'm gonna stay on top of things
It's the middle of summer and the moon is blue
And I'll be 'round waiting for you
Well, another deal gone down
Another man done gone
You put up with it all
And you carry on
Something holding you back
But you'll come through
I'd bet the world and everything in it on you
Happiness is but a state of mind
Anytime you want you can cross the state line
You don't need to be rich or well to do
I'll be 'round waiting for you
<END TEXT>
[Chorus]
Well, Im walking down the line
Im walking down the line
An Im walking down the line
My feetll be a-flying

I got a heavy-headed gal
I got a heavy-headed gal
I got a heavy-headed gal
She aint a-feelin well
When shes better only time will tell

[Verse 2]
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
And rolls and flows and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see the morning light
I see the morning light
Well, its not because
Im an early riser
I didnt go to sleep last night

[Verse 4]
I got my walking shoes
I got my walking shoes
I got my walking shoes
An I aint a-gonna lose
I believe I got the walking blues

[Verse 1]
Oh, the age of the inmates
I remember quite freely
No younger than twelve
No older n seventeen
Thrown in like bandits
And cast off like criminals
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 2]
From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall
Too weary to talk
And too tired to sing
Oh, its all afternoon
You remember your hometown
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 3]
Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire
Stay far from the fence
With the lectricity sting
And its keep down your head
And stay in your number
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 4]
Oh, its fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon
Farewell to the boardwalk
That takes you to the screen
And farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 5]
Its many a guard
That stands around smiling
Holding his club
Like he was a king
Hoping to get you
Behind a wood piling
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 6]
The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows
And the wind punched hard
To make the wall-siding sing
Its many a night
I pretended to be a-sleeping
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 7]
As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunkhouse shingles
And the sounds in the night
They made my ears ring
Till the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning
Inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 8]
Oh, some of usll end up
In St. Cloud Prison
And some of usll wind up
To be lawyers and things
And some of usll stand up
To meet you on your crossroads
From inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

[Verse 1]
Whats the matter with me
I dont have much to say
Daylight sneaking through the window
And Im still in this all-night caf
Walking to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rolling slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

[Verse 2]
Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now Ill just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow

[Chorus]
People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldnt help but cry
Oh, this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does Ill just sit here
And watch the river flow

[Chorus]
People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you want to stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook
But this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does Ill just sit here
And watch the river flow

[Outro]
Watch the river flow
Watching the river flow
Watching the river flow
But Ill sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

[Verse 1]
Love thats pure hopes all things
Believes all things, wont pull no strings
Wont sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
Capture your heart and hold it for ransom

[Chorus]
You dont want a love thats pure
You want to drown love
You want a watered-down love

[Verse 2]
Love thats pure, it dont make no false claims
Intercedes for you stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
Wont write it up and make you sign a false confession

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Love thats pure wont lead you astray
Wont hold you back, wont mess up your day
Wont pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It dont make you envious, it dont make you suspicious

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Love thats pure aint no accident
Always on time, is always content
An eternal flame, quietly burning
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning

[Chorus]
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I think we better talk this over
Maybe when we both get sober
Youll understand Im only a man
Doing the best that I can

[Verse 2]
This situation can only get rougher
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Lets call it a day, go our own different ways
Before we decay

You dont have to be afraid of looking into my face
Weve done nothing to each other time will not erase

[Verse 3]
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance

[Verse 4]
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Im exiled, you cant convert me
Im lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed

You dont have to yearn for love, you dont have to be alone
Somewheres in this universe theres a place that you can call home

[Verse 5]
I guess Ill be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
Itd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh

[Verse 6]
But I dont think its liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clapping
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
Neath the bed where we slept

[Verse 7]
Dont think of me and fantasize on what we never had
Be grateful for what weve shared together and be glad
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually well hang ourselves on all this tangled rope

[Verse 8]
Oh, babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That weve both gone beyond
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me

[Verse 2]
Ever since you walked right in, the circles been complete
Ive said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I havent yet begun

[Verse 3]
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul

[Verse 4]
You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you dont ever rest, theyd kill me if I lie
Id sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die

[Verse 5]
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
Well play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
Whats lost is lost, we cant regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood

[Verse 6]
Its never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesnt bend
And if there is eternity Id love you there again

[Verse 7]
Oh, cant you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
Youre the other half of what I am, youre the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesnt cease

[Verse 8]
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on
Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone

[Verse 1]
Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, Well, well, well
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
How are you? he said to me
I said it back to him

[Verse 2]
I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here

[Verse 3]
Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears

[Verse 4]
I went back to see the gypsy
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsys door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota town
<END TEXT>
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
Get me that fortune telling woman
Want to let her gonna read my mind

If you ever go to Dallas
Take the right hand road
If you ever go to Dallas
Take the right hand road
For wasting down the street boys
Is bound to kill ya for sure

I'm going down to Jackson River
Past that West Texas line
I'm going down to Jackson River
Behind that West Texas line
If there's a star up above
Lord it's mine, leading my sign

Well you never miss your water
Till the well runs dry
And you never miss your water
Till the well runs dry
And you never miss your man
Till he says goodbye

You can ride and tell my mama
I won't be coming home tonight
You can ride and tell my mother
I won't be home tonight
I'm going down the road boys
I've got to do it right

I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
I'm going down to West Texas
Behind the Louisiana line
That fortune telling woman
Won't you let her really read my mind?

[Chorus]
You have given everything to me
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see
What can I do for You?

[Verse 1]
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
And Youve chosen me to be among the few
What can I do for You?

[Chorus]
You have laid down Your life for me
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery
What can I do for You?

[Verse 2]
Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
He gets wise in his own eyes and hes made to believe a lie
Who would deliver him from the death hes bound to die?
Well, Youve done it all and theres no more anyone can pretend to do
What can I do for You?

[Chorus]
You have given all there is to give
What can I do for You?
You have given me life to live
How can I live for You?

[Verse 3]
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts
I dont care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart
Well, I dont deserve it but I sure did make it through
What can I do for You?
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
What good am I if Im like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how youre dressed
If I shut myself off so I cant hear you cry
What good am I?

[Verse 2]
What good am I if I know and dont do
If I see and dont say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
What good am I?

[Verse 3]
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try
What good am I?

[Verse 4]
What good am I then to others and me
If Ive had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?

[Verse 5]
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?

What was it you wanted?
Tell me again so I'll know
What's happening in there
What's going on in your show
What was it you wanted
Could you say it again?
I'll be back in a minute
You can get it together by then

What was it you wanted
You can tell me, I'm back
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track
You got my attention
Go ahead, speak
What was it you wanted
When you were kissing my cheek?

Was there somebody looking
When you give me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed
Something I don't understand
What was it you wanted
Do I have it here in my hand?

Whatever you wanted
Slipped out of my mind
Would you remind me again
If you'd be so kind
Has the record been breaking
Did the needle just skip
Is there somebody waitin'
Was there a slip of the lip?

What was it you wanted
I ain't keepin' score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important?
Maybe not
What was it you wanted?
Tell me again I forgot

Whatever you wanted
What could it be
Did somebody tell you
That you could get it from me
Is it something that comes natural
Is it easy to say
Why do you want it
Who are you anyway?

Is the scenery changing
Am I getting it wrong
Is the whole thing going backwards
Are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?

[Verse 1]
When did you leave heaven ?
How could they let you go ?
How's every thing in heaven ?
I'd like to know

[Verse 2]
Why did you trade heaven ?
For all these earthly things ?
Where on earth you hide halo ?
Where did you lose your wings ?

[Verse 3]
Have they missed you ?
Can you get back in ?
If I kiss you would it be a sin ?
I am only human but you are so divine
When did you leave heaven angel mine ?

[Verse 1]
The iron hand it is no match for the iron rod
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
It is only He who can reduce me to tears
Dont you cry and dont you die and dont you burn
For like a thief in the night, Hell replace wrong with right
When He returns

[Verse 2]
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that therell be no peace, that the war wont cease
Until He returns?

[Verse 3]
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take off your mask
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned
Hes got plans of His own to set up His throne
When He returns

Well I got trouble
Trouble's on my mind
Yep, when I got in trouble
Trouble's on my mind
Well, I'm going to forget my trouble
Leave my trouble behind, behind

I'm going to swing it up
Swing it down
Got the fever, then wham, wham wham!

[Verse 3]
Well, swing your troubles
Swing your troubles away
Yeah, well, swing baby
Swing your troubles today

Yea, yea, yea, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that youre seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where Ive got me a date with Botticellis niece
She promised that shed be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours Ive spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wasting time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see them
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

Sailing round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!

[Verse 3]
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is going to be different
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 1]
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
Where wisdom grows up in strife
My bewildering brain, toils in vain
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
We live and we die, we know not why
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 2]
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 3]
The moon gives light and shines by night
I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O'er the road we're bound to go
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

[Verse 4]
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys
I know they're not what they seem
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
You'll never see me frown
I owe my heart to you, and that's saying' it true
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
<END TEXT>
[Verse 1]
Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
Youve had time to think about it for a while

[Verse 2]
Well, Ive walked two hundred miles, now look me over
Its the end of the chase and the moon is high
It wont matter who loves who
Youll love me or Ill love you
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 3]
I can see through your walls and I know youre hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that youve been flirting
With disaster that you managed to escape

[Verse 4]
I cant provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Youll know all about it, love
Itll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 5]
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
Ive never asked you for nothing you couldnt deliver
Ive never asked you to set yourself up for a fall

[Verse 6]
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, Ive watched them die
Stick around, baby, were not through
Dont look for me, Ill see you
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 7]
In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I dont want to be a fool starving for affection
I dont want to drown in someone elses wine

[Verse 8]
For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind thats howling in your eye
You will seek me and youll find me
In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 9]
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow Ill know you better
When my memory is not so short

[Verse 10]
This time Im asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And youll give it to me now
Ill take it anyhow
When the night comes falling from the sky

Ollie told me I'm a fool. So I
Walked on down the road a mile, Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee, And what do you think he said to me?
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be
Hangin' on a string from your When you believe, You will relieve the only
Soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You can take to the left or go straight to the right
Use your days and save your nights
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be
Hangin' on a string from your When you believe, You will relieve the only
Soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie showed me the fork in the road
Ollie warned me it's a mean old world
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true
But what am I supposed to do
Read the writing on the wall
I heard itwhen I was very small
When You Awake you will remember ev'rything, You will be
Hangin' on a string from your When you believe, You will relieve the only
Soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie showed me the fork in the road
Wash my hand in lye water, I got a date with the
Captains daughter. You can go and tell your brother. We sure gonna
Love one another, Oh! You
May be right and ya might be wrong, I ain't gonna worry all day long
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite, My old car froze
Up last night. Ain't no reason to hang your head I could wake up in the
Mornin' dead. Oh! And
If I thought it would do any good, I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood

God dont make no promises that He dont keep
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep

[Chorus]
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

[Verse 2]
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat and Henry Kissingers got you tied up in knots

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs thatll never cure your ills

[Verse 4]
You got men who cant hold their peace and women who cant control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think Hes just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires

[Chorus]

[Verse 8]
You cant take it with you and you know that its too worthless to be sold
They tell you, Time is money, as if your life was worth its weight in gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 9]
Theres a Man up on a cross and Hes been crucified for you
Beleive in  His power, it's all about you got to do

Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And the morning will be a-breaking

The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

And they'll raise their hands, saying "We'll meet all your demands"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered"
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath they'll be conquered

It isn't by chance I happen to be
A boulevardier, the toast of Paris
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke
I walk in a room, a party or ball
"Come sit over here" somebody will call
"A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all"
But how many times I stop and recall

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lyin' in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young

Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
"Come by for a drink, we're havin' a game"
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of 'em mine
But often my eyes see a different shine

Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was young

[Verse 1]
Theres a long-distance train rolling through the rain
Tears on the letter I write
Theres a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much
But shes drifting like a satellite

[Verse 2]
Theres a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze
Laughter down on Elizabeth Street
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat

[Verse 3]
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise
But he practiced what he preached from the heart
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me
The time and the place that we'd part

[Verse 4]
Theres a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that no one can write
Oh, where are you tonight?

[Verse 5]
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
To live it you had to explode
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
Sacrifice was the code of the road

[Verse 6]
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John
Strong men belittled by doubt
I couldnt tell her what my private thoughts were
But she had some way of finding them out

[Verse 7]
He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And discovered her invisible self

[Verse 8]
Theres a lion in the road, theres a demon escaped
Theres a million dreams gone, theres a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
I wont but then again, maybe I might
Oh, if I could just find you tonight

[Verse 9]
I fought with my twin, that enemy within
Til both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way

[Verse 10]
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin could never get clean
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
But he should-a stayed where his money was green

[Verse 11]
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss, whod never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg

[Verse 12]
Theres a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you dont believe theres a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars

[Verse 13]
Theres a new day at dawn and Ive finally arrived
If Im there in the morning, baby, youll know Ive survived
I cant believe it, I cant believe Im alive
But without you it just doesnt seem right
Oh, where are you tonight?

There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
Well I won't, but then maybe again, I might
Oh, if I could just find you tonight

I fought with my twin, that enemy within
Till both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way

Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin' could never get clean
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green

I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg

There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars

There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived
If I'm-a there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived
I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive
But without you it doesn't seem right
Oh, where are you tonight?
<END TEXT>
Where are you, where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me, where are you
Where's my heart, where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is that happy ending, where are you, where are you
<END TEXT>
Where is the one
Who'll end the search I'm making
Where is the one
Who'll change my dream to waking
Behind some far off secret door
There's my love
There's my life
In store
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do
I'll find love

[Verse 1]
Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall

[Verse 2]
Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall

[Verse 3]
We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

[Verse 4]
Ive torn my clothes and Ive drained the cup
Stripping away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall

[Verse 5]
By rivers of blindness
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat

[Verse 6]
Roses are red, violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall
<END TEXT>
In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There's a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
White dove will mourn in sorrow
The willows will hang their heads
I'll live my life in sorrow
Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore
Why and whats the reason for?

[Verse 1]
Not I, says the referee
Dont point your finger at me
I couldve stopped it in the eighth
And maybe kept him from his fate
But the crowd wouldve booed, Im sure
At not getting their moneys worth
Its too bad he had to go
But there was a pressure on me too, you know
It wasnt me that made him fall
No, you cant blame me at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Not us, says the angry crowd
Whose screams filled the arena loud
Its too bad he died that night
But we just like to see a fight
We didnt mean for him to meet his death
We just meant to see some sweat
There is nothing wrong in that
It wasnt us that made him fall
No, you cant blame us at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Not me, says his manager
Puffing on a big cigar
Its hard to say, its hard to tell
I always thought that he was well
Its too bad for his wife an kids hes dead
But if he was sick, he shouldve said
It wasnt me that made him fall
No, you cant blame me at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Not me, says the gambling man
With his ticket stub still in his hand
It wasnt me that knocked him down
My hands never touched him none
I didnt commit no ugly sin
Anyway, I put money on him to win
It wasnt me that made him fall
No, you cant blame me at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Not me, says the boxing writer
Pounding print on his old typewriter
Saying, Boxing is not to blame
Theres just as much danger in a football game
Saying, Fist fighting is here to stay
Its just the old American way
It wasnt me that made him fall
No, you cant blame me at all

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
Not me, says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cubas door
Where boxing is not allowed no more
I hit him, yes, its true
But thats what I am paid to do
Dont say murder, dont say kill
It was destiny, it was Gods will

[Chorus]

I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain
I've got some habits even I can't explain
Could start for the corner, turn up in Spain
But why try to change me now?

I sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
I'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door
But why try to change me now?

Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk, people stare, so I try
But that's not for me, cause I can't see
My kind of crazy world go passing me by

So, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
Why try to change me now?
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
But why try to change me
Why try to change me now?

Why was I born tell me why I am living
What do I give or what am I'm giving
What do I want anything I can not hope for
What can I hope for I wish I knew

Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you

Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you

Oh, when I left for Wichita
The weather was a-killin' me
And when I left Wichita
The weather was a-killin' me
Well, my poppa said, "Son
Watch out, you might catch that old TB."

When I landed in West Memphis
I sure did not have a dime
When I landed in West Memphis
I sure didn't have a dime
Operator said, "Son
Boy, you ain't no friend of mine."

Operator, operator
Let that poor boy ride
Operator, operator, oh
Let that poor boy ride
Can't you see me on your road
Lord, I'm singing down by the side

I'm going down to Louisiana, oh
Mamma, where that red-green river runs
I'm going down to Louisiana
Mamma, where that red-green river runs, yes
You can write and tell my mamma
My ramblin' days have just begun

Oh, the summer time is coming
And the leaves are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Blooms around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go

If my true love she won't go
Oh, I'll sure find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
From all around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie go

Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idols were clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 2]
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 3]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

[Verse 4]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Verse 5]
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids knock him down

[Verse 6]
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Outro]
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darling
Winterlude by the road tonight
Tonight there will be no quarreling
Everything is gonna be all right
Oh, I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine
Youre the one I adore, come over here and give me more
Then Winterlude, this dude thinks youre fine

[Verse 2]
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude, lets go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold
Winterlude, dont be rude, please be mine

[Verse 3]
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude, its making me lazy
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand
Come out tonight, everything will be tight
Winterlude, this dude thinks youre grand

Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
Is taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
Is made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side

The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you dont count the dead
When Gods on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

Ive learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
Its them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them were forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When Gods on your side

Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I cant think for ya'
Youll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as Im leavin'
Im weary as Hell
The confusion Im feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If Gods on our side
Hell stop the next war

There's an evenin' haze settlin' over town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's getting shallow and weak
Well the place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are reality
If we want to compete abroad

My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
While I'm listenin' to the steel rails a'hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sittin' here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping its way into my gut

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues

Well, I'm sailin' on back
Gettin' ready for the long haul
I'm leaving everythin' behind
If I stay here I could lose it all
The bandits'll rob me blind
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
I'm gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometime nobody want what you got
Sometime you can't give it away

I woke up this morning
And I sprung to my feet
And I went into town on a whim
I saw my father in the street
At least I think it was him
In the dark I hear a song bird call
You know the hills are rugged and steep
But I'll sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
If I told you my whole story you'd weep

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues

Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
It's a long way down, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinkin'
Over the deep blue sea
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinkin'
That you have forgotten me?

Now, they worry and they hurry
Tthey fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
It's a cold black night, and it's midsummer's eve
And the stars are spinnin' around
I'm still finding it so hard to believe
Someone would kick me when I'm down

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues

I'll be back home in a month or two
When the frost is on the vine
Im gonna punch my spear right straight through
Half-ways down his spine
Then Ill lift my arms to the star-lit skies
And Ill pray the fugitive prayer
Im guessin' tomorrow the sun will rise
I hope the final end's been spared

Now the battle is over, up in the hills
And the mist is settlin' in
Look at me with all my spoils
What did I ever win?
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never work a day in their life
They don't know what work even means

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall
I'll sell them to their enemies

Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away

Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death

[Verse 5]
Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?

[Verse 6]
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so

[Verse 8]
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means

Just tell her kindly, "there is the front door."
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

[Verse 7]
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Stranded out in the night
Eliza took me down
To see the widow give
Rain to the town
It's against the law
To be a tonic man
But the widow knows
She's got the upper hand
So I went on in
Feelin' kinda wheezy
You know she soothed my mind, boys
She rocked me kinda slow and easy
All day and all night

Pick a card before you go
It's a long trip to mexico

Eliza wait by the door
I can't stay here anymore, no, no

Then she took a pill
She washed her feet in the mud
She said "look out son
You know, I just ordered a flood
For forty days and forty nights"

Then I dropped my shoes
Eliza called my name
She said it looked to her
Like it's gonna rain
Then the cotton king
Came in chokin'
And the widow laughed and said:
"i ain't jokin'
Take once for all"
She said "now don't ya tease me
I just fell in love, boy
So rock me kinda slow and kinda easy
All day and all night."

Sweet william said
With a drunken head:
"if I had a boat
I'd help y'all float"
Eliza stood there watching
William in a trance
As the widow did the st. vitus dance
But just then an old man
With a boat named "breezy"
Said: "you can ride with clyde, boys
If you rock it kinda slow and easy
All day and all night"

[Verse 1]
You harbor resentment
You know there aint too much of a thrill
You wish for contentment
But you got an emptiness that cant be filled
Youve had enough of hatred
Your bones are breaking, cant find nothing sacred

[Chorus]
Ye shall be changed, ye shall be changed
In a twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet blows
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be changed

[Verse 2]
Everything youve gotten
Youve gotten by sweat, blood and muscle
From early in the morning till way past dark
All you ever do is hustle
All your loved ones have walked out the door
Youre not even sure bout your wife and kids no more, but

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The past dont control you
But the futures like a roulette wheel spinning
Deep down inside
You know you need a whole new beginning
Dont have to go to Russia or Iran
Just surrender to God and Hell move you right here where you stand, and

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
You drink bitter water
And you been eating the bread of sorrow
You cant live for today
When all youre ever thinking of is tomorrow
The path youve endured has been rough
When youve decided that youve had enough, then

Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread

[Verse 2]
Its a one-track town, just brown, and a breeze, too
Pack up the meat, sweet, were heading out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit
Get the loot, dont be slow, were gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, dont be slow, were gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, dont be slow, were gonna catch a trout

[Verse 3]
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle
Bring me my pipe, were gonna shake it
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby

[Verse 4]
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread

Pick up your money

And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To the tree with roots
You aint going nowhere

[Verse 1]
You angel you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing

[Verse 2]
You angel you
Youre as fine as anythings fine
The way you walk and the way you talk
It sure plays on my mind

[Chorus]
You know I cant sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before
I get up at night and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more and more

[Verse 3]
You angel you
Youre as fine as can be
The way you smile like a sweet baby child
It just falls all over me

[Chorus]
You know I cant sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more

You angel you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
It says everything

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise from a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me

See the market place in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too... and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too... and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

[Verse 1]
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Singing about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust
Suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust

[Chorus]
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

[Verse 2]
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal
I do it myself, it's not so unreal
The call of the wild is forever at my door
Wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
I was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite
Eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
While orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass
In the world you had made they made you an outcast

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Invading my privacy making my decisions for me
Holding me back, not letting me stand
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
My Lord and my Savior, my companion, my friend
Heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy
What the world is set against but will never destroy

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You say that you're fed up
You say you're gonna head off
Then you run around packin'
Like a chicken with your head off
I just wanna ask you
Honey where are you at?
'Cause i tell you all the time
You don't have to do that
<END TEXT>
You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

[Verse 1]
Well I told my baby
I said "Baby, I know
Where you been
Well, I know who you are
And what league you played in"
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

[Verse 2]
Well, the night is so empty
So quit and still
For only fifteen
Hundred dollars
You can have anybody killed
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

[Verse 3]
Well, I told my baby
Further down the line
I said, "What happens tomorrow
Is on your head, not mine"
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn

All over town
That you've been seen, a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do, you win again

I'm sorry for your victim now
Ah, soon his head like mine will bow
Yes, he give his heart but all in vain
As some they say, you win again

You have no heart, you have no shame
You take too long and give the blame
I guess I should not complain
I love you still, you win again

Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you when you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

[Verse 1]
Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

[Verse 2]
Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

[Verse 3]
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

[Verse 4]
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way

[Verse 5]
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart

Ive seen love go by my door
Its never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I been shooting in the dark too long
When somethings not right, its wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
Ive only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round its more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 3]
Purple clover, Queen Anne Lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you dont know
Cant remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 1]
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river runnin slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

[Verse 4]
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mineve been like Verlaines and Rimbaud
But theres no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 2]
You're gonna make me wonder what Im doin
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what Im sayin
You're gonna make me give myself a good talkin-to

[Verse 5]
Ill look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But Ill see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in

[Verse 2]
Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
When you give me the blues I want to lay down and die

[Verse 3]
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
Now you're the kind of woman that just don't understand
You're taking all my money and give it to another man

[Verse 4]
Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains
You're that kind of woman drives a man insane
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
